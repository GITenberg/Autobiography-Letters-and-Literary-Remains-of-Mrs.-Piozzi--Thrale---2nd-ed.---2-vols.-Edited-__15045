      THE SECOND EDITION.
    </h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      THE first edition of a work of this kind is almost necessarily
      imperfect; since the editor is commonly dependent for a great
      deal of the required information upon sources the very existence
      of which is unknown to him till reminiscences are revived, and
      communications invited, by the announcement or publication of the
      book. Some valuable contributions reached me too late to be
      properly placed or effectively worked up; some, too late to be
      included at all. The arrangement in this edition will therefore,
      I trust, be found less faulty than in the first, whilst the
      additions are large and valuable. They principally consist of
      fresh extracts from Mrs. Piozzi's private diary ("Thraliana"),
      amounting to more than fifty pages; of additional marginal notes
      on books, and of copious extracts from letters hitherto
      unpublished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the effects of her friend Conway, the actor, after his
      untimely death by drowning in North America, were a copy of Mrs.
      Piozzi's "Travel Book" and a copy of Johnson's "Lives of the
      Poets," each enriched by marginal notes in her handwriting. Such
      of those in the "Travel Book" as were thought worth printing
      appeared in "The Atlantic Monthly" for June last, from which I
      have taken the liberty of copying the best. The "Lives of the
      Poets" is now the property of Mr. William Alexander Smith, of New
      York, who was so kind as to open a communication with me on the
      subject, and to have the whole of the marginal notes transcribed
      for my use at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animated by the same liberal wish to promote a literary
      undertaking, Mr. J.E. Gray, son of the Rev. Dr. Robert Gray, late
      Bishop of Bristol, has placed at my disposal a series of letters
      from Mrs. Piozzi to his father, extending over nearly twenty-five
      years (from 1797 to the year of her death) and exceeding a
      hundred in number. These have been of the greatest service in
      enabling me to complete and verify the summary of that period of
      her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much light is thrown by the new matter, especially by the
      extracts from "Thraliana," on the alleged rupture between Johnson
      and Mrs. Piozzi, that I have re-cast or re-written the part of
      the Introduction relating to it, thinking that no pains should be
      spared to get at the merits of a controversy which now involves,
      not only the moral and social qualities of the great
      lexicographer, but the degree of confidence to be placed in the
      most brilliant and popular of modern critics, biographers and
      historians. It is no impeachment of his integrity, no detraction
      from the durable elements of his fame, to offer proof that his
      splendid imagination ran away with him, or that reliance on his
      wonderful memory made him careless of verifying his original
      impressions before recording them in the most gorgeous and
      memorable language.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one likes to have foolish or erroneous notions imputed to him,
      and I have pointed out some of the misapprehensions into which an
      able writer in the "Edinburgh Review" (No. 231) has been hurried
      by his eagerness to vindicate Lord Macaulay. Moreover, this
      struck me to be as good a form as any for re-examining the
      subject in all its bearings; and now that it has become common to
      reprint articles in a collected shape, the comments of a
      first-rate review can no longer be regarded as transitory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gladly seize the present opportunity to offer my best
      acknowledgments for kind and valuable aid in various shapes, to
      the Marquis of Lansdowne, His Excellency M. Sylvain Van de Weyer
      (the Belgian Minister), the Viscountess Combermere, Mr. and the
      Hon. Mrs. Monckton Milnes, the Hon. Mrs. Rowley, Miss Angharad
      Lloyd, and the Rev. W.H. Owen, Vicar of St. Asaph and Dymerchion.

      INTRODUCTION:
    </h2>
    <h2>
      LIFE AND WRITINGS OF MRS. PIOZZI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson was hailed the colossus of Literature by a generation
      who measured him against men of no common mould&mdash;against
      Hume, Robertson, Gibbon, Warburton, the Wartons, Fielding,
      Richardson, Smollett, Gray, Goldsmith, and Burke. Any one of
      these may have surpassed the great lexicographer in some branch
      of learning or domain of genius; but as a man of letters, in the
      highest sense of the term, he towered pre-eminent, and his
      superiority to each of them (except Burke) in general
      acquirements, intellectual power, and force of expression, was
      hardly contested by his contemporaries. To be associated with his
      name has become a title of distinction in itself; and some
      members of his circle enjoy, and have fairly earned, a peculiar
      advantage in this respect. In their capacity of satellites
      revolving round the sun of their idolatry, they attracted and
      reflected his light and heat. As humble companions of their
      <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>, they did more than live with
      it<span class="fnref">[1]</span>; they gathered and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg004" id="pg004">004</a></span> preserved the
      choicest of its flowers. Thanks to them, his reputation is kept
      alive more by what has been saved of his conversation than by his
      books; and his colloquial exploits necessarily revive the memory
      of the friends (or victims) who elicited and recorded them.

    <p>
      If the two most conspicuous among these have hitherto gained
      notoriety rather than what is commonly understood by fame, a
      discriminating posterity is already beginning to make reparation
      for the wrong. Boswell's "Letters to Temple," edited by Mr.
      Francis, with "Boswelliana," printed for the Philobiblion Society
      by Mr. Milnes, led, in 1857, to a revisal of the harsh sentence
      passed on one whom the most formidable of his censors, Lord
      Macaulay, has declared to be not less decidedly the first of
      biographers, than Homer is the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare
      the first of dramatists, or Demosthenes the first of orators. The
      result was favourable to Boswell, although the vulnerable points
      of his character were still more glaringly displayed. The appeal
      about to be hazarded on behalf of Mrs. Piozzi, will involve
      little or no risk of this kind. Her ill-wishers made the most of
      the event which so injuriously affected her reputation at the
      time of its occurrence; and the marked tendency of every
      additional disclosure of the circumstances has been to elevate
      her. No candid person will read her Autobiography, or her
      Letters, without arriving at the conclusion that her long life
      was morally, if not conventionally, irreproachable; and that her
      talents were <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg005" id=
      "pg005">005</a></span> sufficient to confer on her writings a
      value and attraction of their own, apart from what they possess
      as illustrations of a period or a school. When the papers which
      form the basis of this work were laid before Lord Macaulay, he
      gave it as his opinion that they afforded materials for a "most
      interesting and durably popular volume."<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>

        [1] His letter, dated August 22, 1859, was addressed to Mr. T.
        Longman. The editorship of the papers was not proposed to me
        till after his death, and I had never any personal
        communication with him on the subject; although in the
        Edinburgh Review for July 1857, I ventured, with the same
        freedom which I have used in vindicating Mrs. Piozzi, to
        dispute the paradoxical judgment he had passed on Boswell. The
        materials which reached me after I had undertaken the work, and
        of which he was not aware, would nearly fill a volume.

    <p>
      They comprise:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Autobiographical Memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Letters, mostly addressed to the late Sir James Fellowes.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Fugitive pieces of her composition, most of which have never
      appeared in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Manuscript notes by her on Wraxall's Memoirs, and on her own
      published works, namely: "Anecdotes of the late Samuel Johnson,
      LL.D., during the last twenty years of his life," one volume,
      1786: "Letters to and from the late Samuel Johnson, LL.D.,
      &amp;c.," in two volumes, 1788: "Observations and Reflections
      made in the course of a journey through France, Italy, and
      Germany," in two volumes, 1789: "Retrospection; or, Review of the
      most striking and important Events, Characters, Situations, and
      their Consequences <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg006" id=
      "pg006">006</a></span> which the last Eighteen Hundred Years have
      presented to the View of Mankind," in two volumes, quarto, 1801.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Autobiographical Memoirs," and the annotated books, were
      given by her to the late Sir James Fellowes, of Adbury House,
      Hants, M.D., F.R.S., to whom the letters were addressed. He and
      the late Sir John Piozzi Salusbury were her executors, and the
      present publication takes place in pursuance of an agreement with
      their personal representatives, the Rev. G.A. Salusbury, Rector
      of Westbury, Salop, and Captain J. Butler Fellowes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large and valuable additions to the original stock of materials
      have reached me since the announcement of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Dr. Wellesley, Principal of New Inn Hall, has kindly
      placed at my disposal his copy of Boswell's "Life of Johnson"
      (edition of 1816), plentifully sprinkled with marginal notes by
      Mrs. Piozzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Samuel Lysons, of Hempsted Court, Gloucester, has
      liberally allowed me the free use of his valuable collection of
      books and manuscripts, including numerous letters from Mrs.
      Piozzi to his father and uncle, the Rev. Daniel Lysons and Mr.
      Samuel Lysons.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1776 to 1809 Mrs. Piozzi kept a copious diary and note-book,
      called "Thraliana." Johnson thus alludes to it in a letter of
      September 6th, 1777: "As you have little to do, I suppose you are
      pretty diligent at the 'Thraliana;' and a very curious collection
      posterity will find it. Do not remit the practice <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg007" id="pg007">007</a></span> of writing
      down occurrences as they arise, of whatever kind, and be very
      punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology, you know, is the eye
      of history. Do not omit painful casualties or unpleasing
      passages; they make the variegation of existence; and there are
      many passages of which I will not promise, with Æneas, <i>et hæc
      olim meminisse juvabit</i>." "Thraliana," which at one time she
      thought of burning, is now in the possession of Mr. Salusbury,
      who deems it of too private and delicate a character to be
      submitted to strangers, but has kindly supplied me with some
      curious passages and much valuable information extracted from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall have many minor obligations to acknowledge as I proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless Mrs. Piozzi's character and social position are freshly
      remembered, her reminiscences and literary remains will lose much
      of their interest and utility. It has therefore been thought
      advisable to recapitulate, by way of introduction, what has been
      ascertained from other sources concerning her; especially during
      her intimacy with Johnson, which lasted nearly twenty years, and
      exercised a marked influence on his tone of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This year (1765)," says Boswell, "was distinguished by his
      (Johnson) being introduced into the family of Mr. Thrale, one of
      the most eminent brewers in England, and member of Parliament for
      the borough of Southwark.... Johnson used to give this account of
      the rise of Mr. Thrale's father: 'He worked at six shillings a
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg008" id="pg008">008</a></span>
      week for twenty years in the great brewery, which afterwards was
      his own. The proprietor of it had an only daughter, who was
      married to a nobleman. It was not fit that a peer should continue
      the business. On the old man's death, therefore, the brewery was
      to be sold. To find a purchaser for so large a property was a
      difficult matter; and after some time, it was suggested that it
      would be advisable to treat with Thrale, a sensible, active,
      honest man, who had been employed in the house, and to transfer
      the whole to him for thirty thousand pounds, security being taken
      upon the property. This was accordingly settled. In eleven years
      Thrale paid the purchase money. He acquired a large fortune, and
      lived to be a member of Parliament for Southwark. But what was
      most remarkable was the liberality with which he used his riches.
      He gave his son and daughters the best education. The esteem
      which his good conduct procured him from the nobleman who had
      married his master's daughter made him be treated with much
      attention; and his son, both at school and at the University of
      Oxford, associated with young men of the first rank. His
      allowance from his father, after he left college, was splendid;
      not less than a thousand a year. This, in a man who had risen as
      old Thrale did, was a very extraordinary instance of generosity.
      He used to say, 'If this young dog does not find so much after I
      am gone as he expects, let him remember that he has had a great
      deal in my own time.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      What is here stated regarding Thrale's origin, on <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg009" id="pg009">009</a></span> the alleged
      authority of Johnson, is incorrect. The elder Thrale was the
      nephew of Halsey, the proprietor of the brewery whose daughter
      was married to a nobleman (Lord Cobham), and he naturally
      nourished hopes of being his uncle's successor. In the Abbey
      Church of St. Albans, there is a monument to some members of the
      Thrale family who died between 1676 and 1704, adorned with a
      shield of arms and a crest on a ducal coronet. Mrs. Thrale's
      marginal note on Boswell's account of her husband's family is
      curious and characteristic:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edmund Halsey was son to a miller at St. Albans, with whom he
      quarrelled, like Ralph in the 'Maid of the Mill,' and ran away to
      London with a very few shillings in his pocket.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> He was eminently handsome, and old Child of
      the Anchor Brewhouse, Southwark, took him in as what we call a
      broomstick clerk, to sweep the yard, &amp;c. Edmund Halsey
      behaved so well he was soon preferred to be a house-clerk, and
      then, having free access to his master's table, married his only
      daughter, and succeeded to the business upon Child's demise.
      Being now rich and prosperous, he turned his eyes homewards,
      where he learned that sister Sukey had married a hardworking man
      at Offley in Hertfordshire, and had many children. He sent for
      one of them to London (my Mr. Thrale's father); said he would
      make a man of him, and did so: but made him work very hard, and
      treated him very roughly, Halsey <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg010" id="pg010">010</a></span> being more proud than tender,
      and his only child, a daughter, married to Lord Cobham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Thrale, however, as these fine writers call him,&mdash;then
      a young fellow, and, like his uncle, eminent for personal
      beauty,&mdash;made himself so useful to Mr. Halsey that the
      weight of the business fell entirely on him; and while Edmund was
      canvassing the borough and visiting the viscountess, Ralph Thrale
      was getting money both for himself and his principal: who,
      envious of his success with a wench they both liked but who
      preferred the young man to the old one, died, leaving him never a
      guinea, and he bought the brewhouse of Lord and Lady Cobham,
      making an excellent bargain, with the money he had saved."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] In "Thraliana" she says: "strolled to London with only
        4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in his pocket."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When, in the next page but one, Boswell describes Thrale as
      presenting the character of a plain independent English squire,
      she writes: "No, no! Mr. Thrale's manners presented the character
      of a gay man of the town: like Millamant, in Congreve's comedy,
      he abhorred the country and everything in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      In "Thraliana" after a corresponding statement, she adds: "He
      (the elder Thrale) educated his son and three daughters quite in
      a high style. His son he wisely connected with the Cobhams and
      their relations, Grenvilles, Lyttletons, and Pitts, to whom he
      lent money, and they lent assistance of every other kind, so that
      my Mr. Thrale was bred up at Stowe, and Stoke and Oxford, and
      every genteel place; had been abroad with Lord Westcote, whose
      expenses old Thrale cheerfully paid, I suppose, who was thus a
      kind of tutor to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg011" id=
      "pg011">011</a></span> young man, who had not failed to profit by
      these advantages, and who was, when he came down to Offley to see
      his father's birthplace, a very handsome and well accomplished
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      After expatiating on the advantages of birth, and the presumption
      of new men in attempting to found a new system of gentility,
      Boswell proceeds: "Mr. Thrale had married Miss Hester Lynch
      Salusbury, of good Welsh extraction, a lady of lively talents,
      improved by education. That Johnson's introduction into Mr.
      Thrale's family, which contributed so much to the happiness of
      his life, was owing to her desire for his conversation, is a very
      probable and the general supposition; but it is not the truth.
      Mr. Murphy, who was intimate with Mr. Thrale, having spoken very
      highly of Dr. Johnson, he was requested to make them acquainted.
      This being mentioned to Johnson, he accepted of an invitation to
      dinner at Thrale's, and was so much pleased with his reception
      both by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, and they so much pleased with him,
      that his invitations to their house were more and more frequent,
      till at last he became one of the family, and an apartment was
      appropriated to him, both in their house at Southwark and in
      their villa at Streatham."
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before this was written, Boswell had quarrelled with Mrs.
      Thrale (as it is most convenient to call her till her second
      marriage), and he takes every opportunity of depreciating her. He
      might at least, however, have stated that, instead of sanctioning
      the "general supposition" as to the introduction, she herself
      supplied <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg012" id=
      "pg012">012</a></span> the account of it which he adopts. In her
      "Anecdotes" she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first time I ever saw this extraordinary man was in the year
      1764, when Mr. Murphy, who had long been the friend and
      confidential intimate of Mr. Thrale, persuaded him to wish for
      Johnson's conversation, extolling it in terms which that of no
      other person could have deserved, till we were only in doubt how
      to obtain his company, and find an excuse for the invitation. The
      celebrity of Mr. Woodhouse, a shoemaker, whose verses were at
      that time the subject of common discourse, soon afforded a
      pretence<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and Mr. Murphy brought
      Johnson to meet him, giving me general caution not to be
      surprised at his figure, dress, or behaviour<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>.... Mr. Johnson liked his new acquaintance so
      much, however, that from that time he dined with us every
      Thursday through the winter, and in the autumn of the next year
      he followed us to Brighthelmstone, whence we were gone before his
      arrival; so he was disappointed and enraged, and wrote us a
      letter expressive of anger, which we were very desirous to
      pacify, and to obtain his company again if <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg013" id="pg013">013</a></span> possible. Mr.
      Murphy brought him back to us again very kindly, and from that
      time his visits grew more frequent, till in the year 1766 his
      health, which he had always complained of, grew so exceedingly
      bad, that he could not stir out of his room in the court he
      inhabited for many weeks together, I think months."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "He (Johnson) spoke with much contempt of the notice taken
        of Woodhouse, the poetical shoemaker. He said that it was all
        vanity and childishness, and that such objects were to those
        who patronised them, mere mirrors of their own superiority.
        They had better, said he, furnish the man with good implements
        for his trade, than raise subscriptions for his poems. He may
        make an excellent shoemaker, but can never make a good poet. A
        schoolboy's exercise may be a pretty thing for a schoolboy, but
        it is no treat to a man."&mdash;<i>Maxwell's Collectanea</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The "Anecdotes" were written in Italy, where she had no means of
      reference. The account given in "Thraliana" has a greater air of
      freshness, and proves Boswell right as to the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was on the second Thursday of the month of January, 1765,
      that I first saw Mr. Johnson in a room. Murphy, whose intimacy
      with Mr. Thrale had been of many years' standing, was one day
      dining with us at our house in Southwark, and was zealous that we
      should be acquainted with Johnson, of whose moral and literary
      character he spoke in the most exalted terms; and so whetted our
      desire of seeing him soon that we were only disputing <i>how</i>
      he should be invited, <i>when</i> he should be invited, and what
      should be the pretence. At last it was resolved that one
      Woodhouse, a shoemaker, who had written some verses, and been
      asked to some tables, should likewise be asked to ours, and made
      a temptation to Mr. Johnson to meet him: accordingly he came, and
      Mr. Murphy at four o'clock brought Mr. Johnson to dinner. We
      liked each other so well that the next Thursday was appointed for
      the same company to meet, exclusive of the shoemaker, and since
      then Johnson has remained till this day our constant
      acquaintance, visitor, companion, and friend." <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg014" id="pg014">014</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "Anecdotes" she goes on to say that when she and her
      husband called on Johnson one morning in Johnson's Court, Fleet
      Street, he gave way to such an uncontrolled burst of despair
      regarding the world to come, that Mr. Thrale tried to stop his
      mouth by placing one hand before it, and desired her to prevail
      on him to quit his close habitation for a period and come with
      them to Streatham. He complied, and took up his abode with them
      from before Midsummer till after Michaelmas in that year. During
      the next sixteen years a room in each of their houses was set
      apart for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal difficulty at first was to induce him to live
      peaceably with her mother, who took a strong dislike to him, and
      constantly led the conversation to topics which he detested, such
      as foreign news and politics. He revenged himself by writing to
      the newspapers accounts of events which never happened, for the
      sole purpose of mystifying her; and probably not a few of his
      mischievous fictions have passed current for history. They made
      up their differences before her death, and a Latin epitaph of the
      most eulogistic order from his pen is inscribed upon her tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been well for Mrs. Thrale and her guests if there had
      existed no more serious objection to Johnson as an inmate. At the
      commencement of the acquaintance, he was fifty-six; an age when
      habits are ordinarily fixed: and many of his were of a kind which
      it required no common temper and tact to tolerate or control.
      They had been formed at a period when he was <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg015" id="pg015">015</a></span> frequently
      subjected to the worst extremities of humiliating poverty and
      want. He describes Savage, without money to pay for a night's
      lodging in a cellar, walking about the streets till he was weary,
      and sleeping in summer upon a bulk or in winter amongst the ashes
      of a glass-house. He was Savage's associate on several occasions
      of the sort. He told Sir Joshua Reynolds that, one night in
      particular, when Savage and he walked round St. James's Square
      for want of a lodging, they were not at all depressed; but in
      high spirits, and brimful of patriotism, traversed the square for
      several hours, inveighed against the minister, and "resolved they
      would stand by their country." Whilst at college he threw away
      the shoes left at his door to replace the worn-out pair in which
      he appeared daily. His clothes were in so tattered a state whilst
      he was writing for the "Gentleman's Magazine" that, instead of
      taking his seat at Cave's table, he sate behind a screen and had

      "he had desired me (says Boswell) to change <i>spreads</i> into
      <i>burns.</i> I thought this alteration not only cured
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg016" id="pg016">016</a></span>
      the fault, but was more poetical, as it might carry an allusion
      to the shirt by which Hercules was inflamed." She has written in
      the margin: "Every fever burns I believe; but Bozzy could think
      only on Nessus' dirty shirt, or Dr. Johnson's." In another
      marginal note she disclaims that attention to the Doctor's
      costume for which Boswell gives her credit, when, after relating
      how he had been called into a shop by Johnson to assist in the
      choice of a pair of silver buckles, he adds: "Probably this
      alteration in dress had been suggested by Mrs. Thrale, by
      associating with whom his external appearance was much improved."
      She writes: "it was suggested by Mr. Thrale, not by his wife."

      In general his wigs were very shabby, and their foreparts were
      burned away by the near approach of the candle, which his
      short-sightedness rendered necessary in reading. At Streatham,
      Mr. Thrale's valet had always a better wig ready, with which he
      met Johnson at the parlour door when dinner was announced, and as
      he went up stairs to bed, the same man followed him with another.

      One of his applications to Cave for a trifling advance of money
      is signed <i>Impransus</i> (Dinnerless); and he told Boswell that
      he could fast two days without inconvenience, and had never been
      hungry but once. What he meant by hungry is not easy to explain,
      for his every day manner of eating was that of a half-famished
      man. When at table, he was totally absorbed in the business of
      the moment; his looks were riveted to his plate, till he had
      satisfied his appetite; which was indulged with such in-*
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg017" id="pg017">017</a></span>
      tenseness, that the veins of his forehead swelled, and generally
      a strong perspiration was visible. Until he left off drinking
      fermented liquors altogether, he acted on the maxim "claret for
      boys, port for men, brandy for heroes." He preferred the
      strongest because he said it did its work (<i>i.e.</i>
      intoxicate) the soonest. He used to pour capillaire into his port
      wine, and melted butter into his chocolate. His favourite dishes
      are accurately enumerated by Peter Pindar:

      Mr. Thackeray relates in his "Irish Sketches" that on his asking
      for currant jelly for his venison at a public dinner, the waiter
      replied, "It's all gone, your honour, but there's some capital
      lobster sauce left." This would have suited Johnson equally well,
      or better: he was so fond of lobster sauce that he would call for
      the sauce-boat and pour the whole of its remaining contents over
      his plum pudding. A clergyman who once travelled with him
      relates, "The coach halted as usual for dinner, which seemed to
      be a deeply interesting business to Johnson, who vehemently
      attacked a dish of stewed carp, using his fingers only in feeding
      himself." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg018" id=
      "pg018">018</a></span> At the dinner when he passed his
      celebrated sentence on the leg of mutton&mdash;"That it was as
      bad as bad could be: ill-fed, ill-killed, ill-kept, and
      ill-dressed"&mdash;the ladies, his fellow-passengers, observed
      his loss or equanimity with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of Mrs. Thrale's marginal notes on Boswell refer to her
      illustrious friend's mode of eating. On his reported remark, that
      "a dog will take a small bit of meat as readily as a large, when
      both are before him," she adds, "which Johnson would never have
      done." When Boswell, describing the dinner with Wilkes at
      Davies', says, "No man eat more heartily than Johnson, or loved
      better what was nice and delicate," she strikes in
      with&mdash;"What was gustful rather: what was strong that he
      could taste it, what was tender that he could chew it."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Boswell describes him as occupied for a considerable time in
      reading the "Memoirs of Fontenelle," leaning and swinging upon
      the low gate into the court (at Streatham) without his hat, her
      note is: "I wonder how he liked the story of the
      asparagus,"&mdash;an obvious hint at his selfish habits of
      indulgence at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this he affected great nicety of palate, and did not
      like being asked to a plain dinner. "It was a good dinner
      enough," he would remark, "but it was not a dinner to ask a man
      to." He was so displeased with the performances of a nobleman's
      French cook, that he exclaimed with vehemence, "I'd throw such a
      rascal into the river;" and in reference to one of his Edinburgh
      hosts he said, "As for Maclaurin's imitation of a made dish, it
      was a wretched attempt." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg019"
      id="pg019">019</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was loud, and his gesticulations, voluntary or
      involuntary, singularly uncouth. He had superstitious fancies
      about crossing thresholds or squares in the carpet with the right
      or left leg foremost, and when he did not appear at dinner might
      be found vainly endeavouring to pass a particular spot in the
      anteroom. He loved late hours, or more properly (say Mrs. Thrale)
      hated early ones. Nothing was more terrifying to him than the
      idea of going to bed, which he never would call going to rest, or
      suffer another to call it so. "I lie down that my acquaintance
      may sleep; but I lie down to endure oppressive misery, and soon
      rise again to pass the night in anxiety and pain." When people
      could be induced to sit up with him, they were often amply
      compensated by his rich flow of mind; but the resulting sacrifice
      of health and comfort in an establishment where this sitting up
      became habitual, was inevitably great.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> Instead of being grateful, he always
      maintained that no one forbore his own gratification for the
      purpose of pleasing another, and "if one did sit up, it was
      probably to amuse oneself." Boswell excuses his wife for not
      coinciding in his enthusiasm, by admitting that his illustrious
      friend's irregular hours and uncouth habits, such as turning the
      candles with their ends downwards when they did not burn bright
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg020" id="pg020">020</a></span>
      enough, and letting the wax drop upon the carpet, could not but
      be displeasing to a lady. He was generally last at breakfast, but
      one morning happened to be first and waited some time alone; when
      afterwards twitted by Mrs. Thrale with irregularity, he replied,
      "Madam, I do not like to come down to vacuity."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Dr. Burney states that in 1765 "he very frequently met
        Johnson at Streatham, where they had many long conversations,
        after sitting up as long as the fire and candles lasted, and
        much longer than the patience of the servants subsisted."
      </p>
    </div>

      He was subject to dreadful fits of depression, caused or
      accompanied by compunction for venial or fancied sins, by the
      fear of death or madness&mdash;(the only things he did fear), and
      by ingrained ineradicable disease. When Boswell speaks of his
      "striving against evil," "Ay," she writes in the margin, "and
      against the King's evil."
    </p>
    <p>
      If his early familiarity with all the miseries of destitution,
      aggravated by disease, had increased his natural roughness and
      irritability, on the other hand it had helped largely to bring
      out his sterling virtues,&mdash;his discriminating charity, his
      genuine benevolence, his well-timed generosity, his large-hearted
      sympathy with real suffering. But he required it to be material
      and positive, and scoffed at mere mental or sentimental woes.
      "The sight of people who want food and raiment is so common in
      great cities, that a surly fellow like me has no compassion to
      spare for wounds given only to vanity or softness." He said it
      was enough to make a plain man sick to hear pity lavished on a
      family reduced by losses to exchange a fine house for a snug
      cottage; and when condolence was demanded for a lady of rank in
      mourning for a baby, he contrasted her with a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg021" id="pg021">021</a></span> washerwoman
      with half-a-dozen children dependent on her daily labour for

      Lord Macaulay thus portrays the objects of Johnson's hospitality
      as soon as he had got a house to cover them. "It was the home of
      the most extraordinary assemblage of inmates that ever was
      brought together. At the head of the establishment he had placed
      an old lady named Williams, whose chief recommendations were her
      blindness and her poverty. But in spite of her murmurs and
      reproaches, he gave an asylum to another lady who was as poor as
      herself, Mrs. Desmoulins, whose family he had known many years
      before in Staffordshire. Room was found for the daughter of Mrs.
      Desmoulins, and for another destitute damsel, who was generally
      addressed as Mrs. Carmichael, but whom her generous host called
      Polly. An old quack doctor called Levet, who bled and dosed
      coalheavers and hackney coachmen, and received for fees crusts of
      bread, bits of bacon, glasses of gin, and sometimes a little
      copper, completed this menagerie."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      Mrs. Williams was the daughter of a physician, and of a good
      Welsh family, who did not leave her dependent on Johnson. She is
      termed by Madame D'Arblay a very pretty poet, and was treated
      with uniform respect <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg022" id=
      "pg022">022</a></span> by him.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> All
      the authorities for the account of Levet were collected by
      Hawkins<span class="fnref">[2]</span>: from these it appears that
      his patients were "chiefly of the lowest class of tradesmen," and
      that, although he took all that was offered him by way of fee,
      including meat and drink, he demanded nothing from the poor, nor
      was known in any instance to have enforced the payment of even
      what was justly his due. Hawkins adds that he (Levet) had acted
      for many years in the capacity of surgeon and apothecary to
      Johnson under the direction of Dr. Lawrence.

      Johnson's verses, compared with Lord Macaulay's prose, strikingly
      shew how the same subject can be degraded or elevated by the mode
      of treatment; and how easily the historian or biographer, who

      darken characters at will.

      To complete the picture of Johnson's interior, it should be added
      that the inmates of his house were <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg023" id="pg023">023</a></span> quarrelling from, morning to
      night with one another, with his negro servant, or with himself.
      In one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, he says, "Williams hates
      everybody: Levet hates Desmoulins, and does not love Williams:
      Desmoulins hates them both: Poll (Miss Carmichael) loves none of
      them." In a conversation at Streatham, reported by Madame
      D'Arblay, the <i>menagerie</i> was thus humorously
      described:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mrs. Thrale</i>.&mdash;Mr. Levet, I suppose, Sir, has the
      office of keeping the hospital in health? for he is an
      apothecary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J</i>.&mdash;Levet, Madam, is a brutal fellow, but I have
      a good regard for him; for his brutality is in his manners, not
      his mind.

      "<i>Mr. Thrale</i>.&mdash;But how do you get your dinners drest?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J</i>.&mdash;Why De Mullin has the chief management of
      the kitchen; but our roasting is not magnificent, for we have no
      jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mr. T</i>.&mdash;No jack? Why how do they manage without?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J</i>.&mdash;Small joints, I believe, they manage with a
      string, and larger are done at the tavern. I have some thoughts
      (with a profound gravity) of buying a jack, because I think a
      jack is some credit to a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mr. T</i>.&mdash;Well, but you will have a spit, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J</i>.&mdash;No, Sir, no; that would be superfluous; for
      we shall never use it; and if a jack is seen, a spit will be
      presumed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mrs. T</i>.&mdash;But pray, Sir, who is the Poll you talk
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg024" id="pg024">024</a></span>
      of? She that you used to abet in her quarrels with Mrs. Williams,
      and call out,' At her again, Poll! Never flinch, Poll!'
    </p>

    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J</i>.&mdash;Why I don't rightly remember, but we could
      spare her very well from us. Poll is a stupid slut; I had some
      hopes of her at first; but when I talked to her tightly and
      closely, I could make nothing of her; she was wiggle waggle, and
      I could never persuade her to be categorical."

    <p>
      The effect of an unbroken residence with such inmates, on a man
      of irritable temper subject to morbid melancholy, may be guessed;
      and the merit of the Thrales in rescuing him from it, and in
      soothing down his asperities, can hardly be over-estimated. Lord
      Macaulay says, they were flattered by finding that a man so
      widely celebrated preferred their house to every other in London;
      and suggests that even the peculiarities which seem to unfit him
      for civilised society, including his gesticulations, his
      rollings, his puffings, his mutterings, and the ravenous
      eagerness with which he devoured his food, increased the interest
      which his new associates took in him. His hostess does not appear
      to have viewed them in that light, and she was able to command
      the best company of the intellectual order without the aid of a
      "lion," or a bear. If his conversation attracted many, it drove
      away many, and silenced more. He accounted for the little
      attention <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg025" id=
      "pg025">025</a></span> paid him by the great, by saying that
      "great lords and great ladies do not like to have their mouths
      stopped," as if this was peculiar to them as a class. "My
      leddie," remarks Cuddie in "Old Mortality," "canna weel bide to
      be contradicted, as I ken neabody likes, if they could help
      themselves."

      Johnson was in the zenith of his fame when literature, politics,
      and fashion began to blend together again by hardly perceptible
      shades, like the colours in shot-silk, as they had partially done
      in the Augustan age of Queen Anne. One marked sign was the
      formation of the Literary Club (The Club, as it still claims to
      be called), which brought together Fox, Burke, Gibbon, Johnson,
      Goldsmith, Garrick, Reynolds, and Beauclerc, besides blackballing
      a bishop (the Bishop of Chester), and a lord-chancellor
      (Camden).<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Yet it is curious to
      observe within how narrow a circle of good houses the Doctor's
      engagements were restricted. Reynolds, Paoli, Beauclerc, Allan
      Ramsay, Hoole, Dilly, Strahan, Lord Lucan, Langton, Garrick, and
      the Club formed his main reliance as regards dinners; and we find
      Boswell recording with manifest symptoms of exultation in 1781:
      "I dined with him at a bishop's where were Sir Joshua Reynolds,
      Mr. Berenger, and some more company. He had dined the day before
      at another bishop's." His reverence for the episcopal bench well
      merited some return on their part. Mr. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg026" id="pg026">026</a></span> Seward saw
      him presented to the Archbishop of York, and described his bow to
      an Archbishop as such a studied elaboration of homage, such an
      extension of limb, such a flexion of body, as have seldom or ever
      been equalled. The lay nobility were not equally grateful,
      although his deference for the peerage was extreme. Except in
      Scotland or on his travels, he is seldom found dining with a
      nobleman.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Canning was blackballed the first time he was proposed. He
        was elected in 1798, Mr. Windham being his proposer, and Dr.
        Burney his seconder.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It is therefore hardly an exaggeration to say that he owed more
      social enjoyment to the Thrales than to all the rest of his
      acquaintance put together. Holland House alone, and in its best
      days, would convey to persons living in our time an adequate
      conception of the Streatham circle, when it comprised Burke,
      Reynolds, Garrick, Goldsmith, Boswell, Murphy, Dr. Burney and his
      daughter, Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Crewe, Lord
      Loughborough, Dunning (afterwards Lord Ashburton), Lord Mulgrave,
      Lord Westcote, Sir Lucas and Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Pepys,
      Major Holroyd afterwards Lord Sheffield, the Bishop of London and
      Mrs. Porteous, the Bishop of Peterborough and Mrs. Hinchcliffe,
      Miss Gregory, Miss Streatfield, &amp;c. As at Holland House, the
      chief scene of warm colloquial contest or quiet interchange of
      mind was the library, a large and handsome room, which the pencil
      of Reynolds gradually enriched with portraits of all the
      principal persons who had conversed or studied in it. To supply
      any deficiencies on the shelves, a hundred pounds, Madame
      D'Arblay states, was placed at Johnson's disposal to expend in
      books; and we may take it for <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg027" id="pg027">027</a></span> granted that any new
      publication suggested by him was ordered at once. But a bookish
      couple, surrounded by a literary set, were surely not exclusively
      dependent on him for this description of help, nor laid under any
      extraordinary obligation by reason of it. Whilst the "Lives of
      the Poets" was in progress, Dr. Johnson "would frequently produce
      one of the proof sheets to embellish the breakfast table, which
      was always in the library, and was certainly the most sprightly
      and agreeable meeting of the day." ... "These proof sheets Mrs.
      Thrale was permitted to read aloud, and the discussions to which
      they led were in the highest degree entertaining."<span class=

      It was mainly owing to his domestication with the Thrales that he
      began to frequent drawing-rooms at an age when the arm-chair at
      home or at the club has an irresistible charm for most men of
      sedentary pursuits. It must be admitted that the evening parties
      in which he was seen, afforded a chance of something better than
      the "unidead chatter of girls," with an undue fondness for which
      he reproached Langton; for the <i>Blue Stocking</i> clubs had
      just come into fashion,&mdash;so called from a casual allusion to
      the blue stockings of an <i>habitué</i>, Mr.
      Stillingfleet.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Their founders were
      Mrs. Vesey and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg028" id=

      D'Arblay, "more bland and more gleeful than that of either of
      them, was the personal celebrity of Mrs. Thrale. Mrs. Vesey,
      indeed, gentle and diffident, dreamed not of any competition, but
      Mrs. Montagu and Mrs. Thrale had long been set up as rival
      candidates for colloquial eminence, and each of them thought the
      other alone worthy to be her peer. Openly therefore when they
      met, they combated for precedence of admiration, with placid
      though high-strained intellectual exertion on the one side, and
      an exuberant pleasantry or classical allusion or quotation on the
      other; without the smallest malice in either."

        [1] The first of these was then (about 1768) in the meridian of
        its lustre, but had been instituted many years previously at
        Bath, It owed its name to an apology made by Mr. Stillingfleet
        in declining to accept an invitation to a literary meeting at
        Mrs. Vesey's, from not being, he said, in the habit of
        displaying a proper equipment for an evening assembly. "Pho,
        pho," said she, "don't mind dress. Come in your blue
        stockings." With which words, humorously repeating them as he
        entered the apartment of the chosen coterie, Mr. Stillingfleet
        claimed permission for entering according to order. And these
        words, ever after, were fixed, in playful stigma, upon Mrs.
        Vesey's associations. <i>(Madame D'Arblay.)</i> Boswell also
        traces the term to Stillingfleet's blue stockings; and Hannah
        More's "Bas-Bleu" gave it a permanent place in literature.

      A different account of the origin of Bluestocking parties was
      given by Lady Crewe to a lady who has allowed me to copy her note
      of the conversation, made at the time (1816):
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Crewe told me that her mother (Mrs. Greville), the Duchess
      of Portland, and Mrs. Montagu were the first who began the
      conversation parties in imitation of the noted ones, <i>temp.</i>
      Madame de Sevigne', at Rue St. Honore. Madame de Polignac, one of
      the first guests, came in blue silk stockings, then the newest
      fashion in Paris. Mrs. Greville and all the lady members of Mrs.
      Montagu's <i>club</i>, adopted the <i>mode</i>. A foreign
      gentleman, after spending an evening at Mrs. Montagu's
      <i>soirée</i>, wrote to tell a friend of the charming
      intellectual party, who had one rule; 'they wear blue stockings
      as a distinction.'" <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg029" id=
      "pg029">029</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wraxall, who makes the same comparison, remarks: "Mrs. Thrale
      always appeared to me to possess at least as much information, a
      mind as cultivated, and more brilliancy of intellect than Mrs.
      Montagu, but she did not descend among men from such an eminence,
      and she talked much more, as well as more unguardedly, on every
      subject. She was the provider and conductress of Johnson, who
      lived almost constantly under her roof, or more properly under
      that of Mr. Thrale, both in Town and at Streatham. He did not,
      however, spare her more than other women in his attacks if she
      courted and provoked his animadversions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he seldom appeared to greater advantage than when under
      the combined spell of feminine influence and rank, his demeanour
      varied with his mood. On Miss Monkton's (afterwards Countess of
      Cork) insisting, one evening, that Sterne's writings were very
      pathetic, Johnson bluntly denied it. "I am sure," she rejoined,
      "they have affected me." "Why," said Johnson, smiling and rolling
      himself about, "that is because, dearest, you're a dunce." When
      she some time afterwards mentioned this to him, he said, with
      equal truth and politeness, "Madam, if I had thought so, I
      certainly should not have said it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not come off so well on another occasion, when the
      presence of women he respected might be expected to operate as a
      cheek. Talking, at Mrs. Garrick's, of a very respectable author,
      he told us, says Boswell, "a curious circumstance in his life,
      which was that he had married a printer's devil. <i>Reynolds</i>.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg030" id="pg030">030</a></span>
      'A printer's devil, Sir! why, I thought a printer's devil was a
      creature with a black face and in rags.' <i>Johnson</i>. 'Yes,
      Sir. But I suppose he had her face washed, and put clean clothes
      on her.' Then, looking very serious, and very earnest. 'And she
      did not disgrace him;&mdash;the woman had a bottom of good
      sense.' The word <i>bottom</i> thus introduced was so ludicrous
      when contrasted with his gravity, that most of us could not
      forbear tittering and laughing; though I recollect that the
      Bishop of Killaloe kept his countenance with perfect steadiness,
      while Miss Hannah More slily hid her face behind a lady's back
      who sat on the same settee with her. His pride could not bear
      that any expression of his should excite ridicule, when he did
      not intend it: he therefore resolved to assume and exercise
      despotic power, glanced sternly around, and called out in a
      strong tone, 'Where's the merriment?' Then collecting himself,
      and looking awful, to make us feel how he could impose restraint,
      and as it were searching his mind for a still more ludicrous
      word, he slowly pronounced, 'I say the <i>woman</i> was
      <i>fundamentally</i> sensible;' as if he had said, Hear this now,
      and laugh if you dare. We all sat composed as at a funeral."
    </p>
    <p>
      This resembles the influence exercised by the "great commoner"
      over the House of Commons. An instance being mentioned of his
      throwing an adversary into irretrievable confusion by an arrogant
      expression of contempt, the late Mr. Charles Butler asked the
      relator, an eye-witness, whether the House did not laugh at the
      ridiculous figure of the poor member. "No, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg031" id="pg031">031</a></span> Sir," was the
      reply, "we were too much awed to laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a marked feature in Johnson's character that he was fond
      of female society; so fond, indeed, that on coming to London he
      was obliged to be on his guard against the temptations to which
      it exposed him. He left off attending the Green Room, telling
      Grarrick, "I'll come no more behind your scenes, Davy; for the
      silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my
      amorous propensities."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proneness of his imagination to wander in this forbidden
      field is unwittingly betrayed by his remarking at Sky, in support
      of the doctrine that animal substances are less cleanly than
      vegetable: "I have <i>often</i> thought that, if I kept a
      seraglio, the ladies should all wear linen gowns, or cotton, I
      mean stuffs made of vegetable substances. I would have no silks:
      you cannot tell when it is clean: it will be very nasty before it
      is perceived to be so; linen detects its own dirtiness." His
      virtue thawed instead of becoming more rigid in the North. "This
      evening," records Boswell of their visit to an Hebridean chief,
      "one of our married ladies, a lively pretty little woman,
      good-humouredly sat down upon Dr. Johnson's knee, and being
      encouraged by some of the company, put her hands round his neck
      and kissed him. 'Do it again,' said he, 'and let us see who will
      tire first.' He kept her on his knee some time whilst he and she
      drank tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Dr. Maxwell relates in his "Collectanea," that "Two
      young women from Staffordshire visited <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg032" id="pg032">032</a></span> him when I
      was present, to consult him on the subject of Methodism, to which
      they were inclined. 'Come,' said he, 'you pretty fools, dine with
      Maxwell and me at the Mitre, and we will talk over that subject:'
      which they did, and after dinner he took one of them upon his
      knee, and fondled her for half an hour together." <span class=

        sense of their condition. I remember, he said, once asking one

      Johnson, despite of his unwieldy figure, scarred features and
      uncouth gestures, was a favourite with the fair, and talked of
      affairs of the heart as things of which he was entitled to speak
      from personal experience as confidently as of any other moral or
      social topics. He told Mrs. Thrale, without the smallest
      consciousness of presumption or what Mr. Square would term the
      unfitness of things, of his and Lord Lyttleton's having contended
      for Miss Boothby's preference with an emulation that occasioned
      hearty disgust and ended in lasting animosity. "You may see," he
      added, when the Lives of the Poets were printed, "that dear
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg033" id="pg033">033</a></span>
      Boothby is at my heart still. She would delight in that fellow

      Mr. Croker surmises that "Molly Aston," not "dear Boothby," must
      have been the object of this rivalry<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>; and the surmise is strengthened by Johnson's
      calling Molly the loveliest creature he ever saw; adding (to Mrs.
      Thrale), "My wife was a little jealous, and happening one day
      when walking in the country to meet a fortune-hunting gipsy, Mrs.
      Johnson made the wench look at my hand, but soon repented of her
      curiosity,'for,' says the gipsy, 'your heart is divided between a
      Betty and a Molly: Betty loves you best, but you take most
      delight in Molly's company.' When I turned about to laugh, I saw
      my wife was crying. Pretty charmer, she had no reason." This
      pretty charmer was in her forty-eighth year when he married her,
      he being then twenty-seven. He told Beauclerc that it was a love
      match on both sides; and Garrick used to draw ludicrous pictures
      of their mutual fondness, which he heightened by representing her
      as short, fat, tawdrily dressed, and highly rouged.

      On the question whether "Molly Aston" or "dear <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg034" id="pg034">034</a></span> Boothby" was
      the cause of his dislike of Lyttleton, one of Mrs. Piozzi's
      marginal notes is decisive. "Mrs. Thrale (says Boswell) suggests
      that he was offended by Molly Aston's preference of his lordship
      to him." She retorts: "I never said so. I believe Lord Lyttleton
      and Molly Aston were not acquainted. No, no: it was Miss Boothby
      whose preference he professed to have been jealous of, and so I
      said in the 'Anecdotes.'"

    <p>
      One of Rochefoucauld's maxims is: "Young women who do not wish to
      appear <i>coquette</i>, and men of advanced years who do not wish
      to appear ridiculous, should never speak of love as of a thing in
      which they might take part." Mrs. Thrale relates an amusing
      instance of Johnson's adroitness in escaping from the dilemma:
      "As we had been saying one day that no subject failed of
      receiving dignity from the manner in which Mr. Johnson treated
      it, a lady at my house said, she would make him talk about love;
      and took her measures accordingly, deriding the novels of the day
      because they treated about love. 'It is not,' replied our
      philosopher, 'because they treat, as you call it, about love, but
      because they treat of nothing, that they are despicable: we must
      not ridicule a passion which he who never felt, never was happy,
      and he who laughs at, never deserves to feel&mdash;a passion
      which has caused the change of empires, and the loss of
      worlds&mdash;a passion which has inspired heroism and subdued
      avarice.' He thought he had already said too much. 'A passion, in
      short,' added he, with an altered tone, 'that consumes me away
      for my pretty Fanny here, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg035"
      id="pg035">035</a></span> and she 'is very cruel,' speaking of
      another lady (Miss Burney) in the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the high-flown language which he occasionally employed in
      addressing or discussing women, has originated a theory that the
      basis or essence of his character was romance, it may be as well
      to contrast what he said in soberer moods on love. He remarked to
      Dr. Maxwell, that "its violence and ill-effects were much
      exaggerated; for who knows any real sufferings on that head, more
      than from the exorbitancy of any other passion?" On Boswell
      asking him whether he did not suppose that there are fifty women
      in the world with any of whom a man may be as happy as with any
      one woman in particular, he replied, "Ay, Sir, fifty thousand. I
      believe marriages would in general be as happy, and often more
      so, if they were all made by the lord-chancellor upon a due
      consideration of the characters and circumstances without the
      parties having any choice in the matter." On another occasion he
      observed that sensible men rarely married for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      These peculiarities throw light on more questions than one
      relating to Johnson's prolonged intimacy and alleged quarrel with
      Mrs. Thrale. His gallantry, and the flattering air of deferential
      tenderness which he threw into his commerce with his female
      favourites, may have had little less to do with his domestication
      at Streatham than his celebrity, his learning, or his wit. The
      most submissive wife will manage to dislodge an inmate who is
      displeasing to her, "Aye, a marriage, man," said Bucklaw to his
      led captain, "but wherefore droops thy mighty <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg036" id="pg036">036</a></span> spirit? The
      board will have a corner, and the corner will have a trencher,
      and the trencher will have a glass beside it; and the board end
      shall be filled, and the trencher and the glass shall be
      replenished for thee, if all the petticoats in Lothian had sworn
      the contrary." "So says many an honest fellow," said Craigenfelt,
      "and some of my special friends; but curse me if I know the
      reason, the women could never bear me, and always contrived to
      trundle me out before the honey-moon was over."<span class=

      It was all very well for Johnson to tell Boswell, "I know no man
      who is more master of his wife and family than Thrale. If he
      holds up a finger, he is obeyed." The sage never acted on the
      theory, and instead of treating the wife as a cipher, lost no
      opportunity of paying court to her, though in a manner quite
      compatible with his own lofty spirit of independence and
      self-respect. Thus, attention having been called to some Italian
      verses by Baretti, he converted them into an elegant compliment
      to her by an improvised paraphrase:

      "On another occasion," says Mrs. Thrale, in the "Anecdotes," "I
      can boast verses from Dr. Johnson. As I went into his room the
      morning of my birthday once and said to him, 'Nobody sends me any
      verses now, because I am five-and-thirty years old; and Stella
      was fed with them till forty-six, I remember.' My being just
      recovered from illness and confinement will account for the
      manner in which he burst out suddenly, for so he did without the
      least previous hesitation whatsoever, and without having
      entertained the smallest intention towards it half a minute
      before:

      Lady Aldborough, whose best witticisms unluckily lie under the
      same merited ban as Rochester's best verses, resolved not to pass
      twenty-five, and had her passport made out accordingly till her
      death at eighty-five. She used to boast that, whenever a foreign
      official objected, she never failed to silence him by the remark,
      that he was the first gentleman of his country who ever told a
      lady she was older than she said she was. Actuated probably by a
      similar feeling, and in the hope of securing to herself the
      benefit of the doubt, Mrs. Thrale omitted in the "Anecdotes" the
      year when these verses were addressed to her, and a sharp
      controversy has been raised as to the respective ages of herself
      and Dr. Johnson at the time. It is thus summed up by one of the
      combatants:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one place Mr. Croker says that at the commencement of the
      intimacy between Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale, in 1765, the lady
      was twenty-five years old. In other places he says that Mrs.
      Thrale's thirty-fifth year coincided with Johnson's seventieth.
      Johnson was born <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg040" id=
      "pg040">040</a></span> in 1709. If, therefore, Mrs. Thrale's
      thirty-fifth year coincided with Johnson's seventieth, she could
      have been only twenty-one years old in 1765. This is not all. Mr.
      Croker, in another place, assigns the year 1777 as the date of
      the complimentary lines which Johnson made on Mrs. Thrale's
      thirty-fifth birthday. If this date be correct Mrs. Thrale must
      have been born in 1742, and could have been only twenty-three
      when her acquaintance commenced. Mr. Croker, therefore, gives us
      three different statements as to her age. Two of the three must
      be incorrect. We will not decide between them."<span class=

      Mr. Salusbury, referring to a china bowl in his possession, says:
      "The slip of paper now in it is in my father's handwriting, and
      copied, I have heard him say, from the original slip, which was
      worn out by age and fingering. The exact words are, 'In this
      bason was baptised Hester Lynch Salusbury, 16th Jan. 1740-41 old
      style, at Bodville in Carnarvonshire.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident of the verses is thus narrated in "Thraliana": "And
      this year, 1777<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, when I told him
      that it was my birthday, and that I was then thirty-five years
      old, he repeated me these verses, which I wrote down from his
      mouth as he made them." If she was born in 1740-41, she must have
      been thirty-six in 1777; and there is no perfectly satisfactory
      settlement of the controversy, which many will think derives its
      sole importance from the two chief controversialists.

      The highest authorities differ equally about her looks. "My
      readers," says Boswell, "will naturally wish for some
      representation of the figures of this couple. Mr. Thrale was
      tall, well-proportioned, and stately. As for <i>Madam</i>, or
      <i>My Mistress</i>, by which epithets Johnson used to mention
      Mrs. Thrale, she was short, plump, and brisk." "He should have
      added," observes Mr. Croker, "that she was very pretty." This was
      not her own opinion, nor that of her cotemporaries, although her
      face was attractive from animation and expression, and her
      personal appearance pleasing on the whole. Sometimes, when
      visiting the author of "Piozziana,"<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
      she used to look at her little self, as she called it, and spoke
      drolly of what she once was, as if speaking of some one else; and
      one day, turning to him, she exclaimed: "No, I never was
      handsome: I had always too many strong points in my face for
      beauty." On his expressing a doubt of this, and hinting that Dr.
      Johnson was certainly an admirer of her personal charms, she
      replied that his devotion was at least as warm towards the table
      and the table-cloth at Streatham.

        Remarks. By a Friend." (The Rev. E. Mangin.) Moxon, 1833. These
        reminiscences, unluckily limited to the last eight or ten years
        of her life at Bath, contain much curious information, and
        leave a highly favourable impression of Mrs. Piozzi.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      One day when he was ill, exceedingly low-spirited, and persuaded
      that death was not far distant, she appeared before him in a
      dark-coloured gown, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg042"
      id="pg042">042</a></span> his bad sight, and worse apprehensions,
      made him mistake for an iron-grey. "'Why do you delight,' said
      he, 'thus to thicken the gloom of misery that surrounds me? is
      not here sufficient accumulation of horror without anticipated
      mourning?'&mdash;'This is not mourning, Sir!' said I, drawing the
      curtain, that the light might fall upon the silk, and show it was
      a purple mixed with green.&mdash;'Well, well!' replied he,
      changing his voice; 'you little creatures should never wear those
      sort of clothes, however; they are unsuitable in every way. What!
      have not all insects gay colours?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the author of "Piozziana," who became acquainted
      with her late in life, "She was short, and though
      well-proportioned, broad, and deep-chested. Her hands were
      muscular and almost coarse, but her writing was, even in her
      eightieth year, exquisitely beautiful; and one day, while
      conversing with her on the subject of education, she observed
      that 'all Misses now-a-days, wrote so like each other, that it
      was provoking;' adding, 'I love to see individuality of
      character, and abhor sameness, especially in what is feeble and
      flimsy.' Then, spreading her hand, she said, 'I believe I owe
      what you are pleased to call my good writing, to the shape of
      this hand, for my uncle, Sir Robert Cotton, thought it was too
      manly to be employed in writing like a boarding-school girl; and
      so I came by my vigorous, black manuscript.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that the hand-writing compensated for the hands;
      and as she attached great importance to blood and race, that she
      did not live to read Byron's <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span> "thoroughbred and tapering
      fingers," or to be shocked by his theory that "the hand is almost
      the only sign of blood which aristocracy can generate." Her Bath
      friend appeals to a miniature (engraved for this work) by Roche,
      of Bath, taken when she was in her seventy-seventh year. Like
      Cromwell, who told the painter that if he softened a harsh line
      or so much as omitted a wart, he should never be paid a
      sixpence,&mdash;she desired the artist to paint her face deeply
      rouged, which it always was<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and to
      introduce a trivial deformity of the jaw, produced by a horse
      treading on her as she lay on the ground after a fall. In this
      respect she proved superior to Johnson; who, with all his love of
      truth, could not bear to be painted with his defects. He was
      displeased at being drawn holding a pen close to his eye; and on
      its being suggested that Reynolds had painted himself holding his
      ear in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg044" id=
      "pg044">044</a></span> hand to catch the sound, he replied: "He
      may paint himself as deaf as he pleases, but I will not be
      Blinking Sam."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "One day I called early at her house, and as I entered her
        drawing-room, she passed me, saying, 'Dear Sir, I will be with
        you in a few minutes; but, while I think of it, I must go to my
        dressing-closet and paint my face, which I forgot to do this
        morning.' Accordingly she soon returned, wearing the requisite
        quantity of bloom; which, it must be noticed, was not in the
        least like that of youth and beauty. I then said that I was
        surprised she should so far sacrifice to fashion, as to take
        that trouble. Her answer was that, as I might conclude, her
        practice of painting did not proceed from any silly compliance
        with Bath fashion, or any fashion; still less, if possible,
        from the desire of appearing younger than she was, but from
        this circumstance, that in early life she had worn rouge, as
        other young persons did in her day, as a part of dress; and
        after continuing the habit for some years, discovered that it
        had introduced a dull yellow colour into her complexion, quite
        unlike that of her natural skin, and that she wished to conceal
        the deformity."&mdash;<i>Piozziana</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Reynolds' portrait of Mrs. Thrale conveys a highly agreeable
      impression of her; and so does Hogarth's, when she sat to him for
      the principal figure in "The Lady's Last Stake." She was then
      only fourteen; and he probably idealised his model; but that he
      also produced a striking likeness, is obvious on comparing his
      picture with the professed portraits. The history of this picture
      (which has been engraved, at Lord Macaulay's suggestion, for this
      work) will be found in the Autobiography and the Letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell's account of his first visit to Streatham gives a
      tolerably fair notion of the footing on which Johnson stood
      there, and the manner in which the interchange of mind was
      carried on between him and the hostess. This visit took place in
      October, 1769, four years after Johnson's introduction to her;
      and Boswell's absence from London, in which he had no fixed
      residence during Johnson's life, will hardly account for the
      neglect of his illustrious friend in not procuring him a
      privilege which he must have highly coveted and would doubtless
      have turned to good account.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the 6th of October I complied with this obliging invitation;
      and found, at an elegant villa, six miles from town, every
      circumstance that can make society pleasing. Johnson, though
      quite at home, was yet looked up to with an awe, tempered by
      affection, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg045" id=
      "pg045">045</a></span> seemed to be equally the care of his host
      and hostess. I rejoiced at seeing him so happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale disputed with him on the merit of Prior. He attacked
      him powerfully; said he wrote of love like a man who had never
      felt it; his love verses were college verses: and he repeated the
      song, 'Alexis shunn'd his fellow swains,' &amp;c. in so ludicrous
      a manner, as to make us all wonder how any one could have been
      pleased with such fantastical stuff. Mrs. Thrale stood to her
      guns with great courage, in defence of amorous ditties, which
      Johnson despised, till he at last silenced her by saving, 'My
      dear lady, talk no more of this. Nonsense can be defended but by
      nonsense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale then praised Garrick's talents for light gay poetry;
      and, as a specimen, repeated his song in 'Florizel and Perdita,'
      and dwelt with peculiar pleasure on this line:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'I'd smile with the simple, and feed with the poor.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "<i>Johnson.</i>&mdash;'Nay, my dear lady, this will never do.
      Poor David! Smile with the simple!&mdash;what folly is that? And
      who would feed with the poor that can help it? No, no; let me
      smile with the wise, and feed with the rich.'" Boswell adds, that
      he repeated this sally to Glarrick, and wondered to find his
      sensibility as a writer not a little irritated by it; on which
      Mrs. Thrale remarks, "How odd to go and tell the man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The independent tone she took when she deemed the Doctor
      unreasonable, is also proved by Boswell in his report of what
      took place at Streatham in reference to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg046" id="pg046">046</a></span> Lord
      Marchmont's offer to supply information for the Life of Pope:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elated with the success of my spontaneous exertion to procure
      material and respectable aid to Johnson for his very favourite
      work, 'the Lives of the Poets,' I hastened down to Mr. Thrale's,
      at Streatham, where he now was, that I might insure his being at
      home next day; and after dinner, when I thought he would receive
      the good news in the best humour, I announced it eagerly: 'I have
      been at work for you to-day, Sir. I have been with Lord
      Marchmont. He bade me tell you he has a great respect for you,
      and will call on you to-morrow at one o'clock, and communicate
      all he knows about Pope.' <i>Johnson.</i> 'I shall not be in town
      to-morrow. I don't care to know about Pope.' <i>Mrs. Thrale</i>
      (surprised, as I was, and a little angry). 'I suppose, Sir, Mr.
      Boswell thought that as you are to write Pope's Life, you would
      wish to know about him.' <i>Johnson.</i> 'Wish! why yes. If it
      rained knowledge, I'd hold out my hand; but I would not give
      myself the trouble to go in quest of it.' There was no arguing
      with him at the moment. Sometime afterwards he said, 'Lord
      Marchmont will call upon me, and then I shall call on Lord
      Marchmont.' Mrs. Thrale was uneasy at this unaccountable caprice:
      and told me, that if I did not take care to bring about a meeting
      between Lord Marchmont and him, it would never take place, which
      would be a great pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing conversation is a good sample of the freedom and
      variety of "talk" in which Johnson luxuriated, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg047" id="pg047">047</a></span> and shows how
      important a part Mrs. Thrale played in it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale told us, that a curious clergyman of our
      acquaintance (Dr. Lort is named in the margin) had discovered a
      licentious stanza, which Pope had originally in his 'Universal
      Prayer,' before the stanza,&mdash;

      <p>
        "'What conscience dictates to be done,

    <p>
      and that Dr. Johnson observed, it had been borrowed from
      <i>Guarini</i>. There are, indeed, in <i>Pastor Fido</i>, many
      such flimsy superficial reasonings as that in the last two lines
      of this stanza.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Boswell</i>. 'In that stanza of Pope's, "<i>rod of fires</i>"
      is certainly a bad metaphor.' <i>Mrs. Thrale</i>. 'And "sins of

      <i>momentous</i>, which cannot be intended.' <i>Johnson</i>. 'It
      must have been written "of <i>moments</i>." Of <i>moment</i>, is
      <i>momentous</i>; of <i>moments, momentary</i>. I warrant you,
      however, Pope wrote this stanza, and some friend struck it out.'

      'Ask any man if he'd wish not to know of such an injury.'
      <i>Boswell</i>. 'Would you tell your friend to make him unhappy?'
      <i>Johnson</i>. 'Perhaps, Sir, I should not: but that would be
      from prudence on my own account. A man would tell his father.'
      <i>Boswell</i>. 'Yes; because he would not have spurious children
      to get any share of the family inheritance.' <i>Mrs. Thrale</i>.
      'Or he would tell his brother.' <i>Boswell</i>. 'Certainly his
      <i>elder</i> brother.... Would you tell Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?'
      (naming a gentleman who assuredly was not in the least danger of
      so miserable a disgrace, though married to a fine woman).
      <i>Johnson</i>. 'No, Sir: because it would do no good; he is so
      sluggish, he'd never go to Parliament and get through a
      divorce.'" <i>Marginal Note</i>: "Langton."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is every reason to believe that her behaviour to Johnson
      was uniformly marked by good-breeding and delicacy. She treated
      him with a degree of consideration and respect which he did not
      always receive from other friends and admirers. A foolish rumour
      having got into the newspapers that he had been learning to dance
      of Vestris, it was agreed that Lord Charlemont should ask him if
      it was true, and his lordship with (it is shrewdly observed) the
      characteristic spirit of a general of Irish volunteers, actually
      put the question, which provoked a passing feeling of irritation.
      Opposite Boswell's account of this incident she has written, "Was
      he not right in hating to be so treated? and would he not have
      been right to have <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg049" id=
      "pg049">049</a></span> loved me better than any of them, because
      I never did make a Lyon of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One great charm of her companionship to cultivated men was her
      familiarity with the learned languages, as well as with French,
      Italian, and Spanish. The author of "Piozziana" says: "She not
      only read and wrote Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, but had for sixty
      years constantly and ardently studied the Scriptures and the
      works of commentators in the original languages." She did not
      know Greek, and he probably over-estimated her other
      acquirements, which Boswell certainly underestimates when he
      speaks slightingly of them on the strength of Johnson's having
      said: "It is a great mistake to suppose that she is above him
      (Thrale) in literary attainments. She is more flippant, but he
      has ten times her learning: he is a regular scholar; but her
      learning is that of a school-boy in one of the lower forms." If
      this were so, it is strange that Thrale should cut so poor a
      figure, should seem little better than a nonentity, whilst every
      imaginable topic was under animated discussion at his table; for
      Boswell was more ready to report the husband's sayings than the
      wife's. In a marginal note on one of the printed letters she
      says: "Mr. Thrale was a very merry talking man in 1760; but the
      distress of 1772, which affected his health, his hopes, and his
      whole soul, affected his temper too. Perkins called it being
      planet struck, and I am not sure he was ever completely the same
      man again." The notes of his conversation during the antecedent
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg050" id="pg050">050</a></span>
      period are equally meagre.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> He is
      described by Madame D'Arblay as taking a singular amusement in
      hearing, instigating, and provoking a war of words, alternating
      triumph and overthrow, between clever and ambitious colloquial
      combatants.

      of the "Gentleman's Magazine" suggests that Johnson had in his

      Paris, habited as a Jesuit, during the height of the contention
      between the Jansenists and Molinists concerning free will:&mdash;

        Mrs. Thrale took the lead even when her husband might be
        expected to strike in, as when Johnson was declaiming
        paradoxically against action in oratory: "Action can have no
        effect on reasonable minds. It may augment noise, but it never
        can enforce argument." <i>Mrs. Thrale</i>. "What then, Sir,
        becomes of Demosthenes' saying, Action, action, action?"
        <i>Johnson</i>. "Demosthenes, Madam, spoke to an assembly of

        her marginal protest, and a conclusive one.

      reference to the flattery lavished on Garrick by Lord Mansfield
      and Lord Chatham, Johnson had said, "When he whom everybody else
      flatters, flatters me, then I am truly happy." <i>Mrs.

      In one of her letters to him (June, 1782) she writes: "Meantime
      let us be as <i>merry</i> as reading Burton upon
      <i>Melancholy</i> will make us. You bid me study that book in
      your absence, and now, what have I found? Why, I have found, or
      fancied, that he has been cruelly plundered: that Milton's first
      idea of 'L'Allegro' and 'Il Penseroso' were suggested by the
      verses at the beginning; that Savage's speech of Suicide in the
      'Wanderer' grew <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg053" id=
      "pg053">053</a></span> up out of a passage you probably remember
      towards the 216th page; that Swift's tale of the woman that holds
      water in her mouth, to regain her husband's love by silence, had
      its source in the same farrago; and that there is an odd
      similitude between my Lord's trick upon Sly the Tinker, in
      Shakspeare's 'Taming of the Shrew,' and some stuff I have been
      reading in Burton."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be easy to heap proof upon proof of the value and
      variety of Mrs. Thrale's contributions to the colloquial
      treasures accumulated by Boswell and other members of the set;
      and Johnson's deliberate testimony to her good qualities of head
      and heart will far more than counterbalance any passing
      expressions of disapproval or reproof with her mistimed vivacity,
      or alleged disregard of scrupulous accuracy in narrative, may
      have called forth. No two people ever lived much together for a
      series of years without many fretful, complaining, dissatisfied,
      uncongenial moments,&mdash;without letting drop captious or
      unkind expressions, utterly at variance with their habitual
      feelings and their matured judgments of each other. The hasty
      word, the passing sarcasm, the sly hit at an acknowledged foible,
      should count for nothing in the estimate, when contrasted with
      earnest and deliberate assurances, proceeding from one who was
      commonly too proud to flatter, and in no mood for idle compliment
      when he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never (he writes in 1773) imagine that your letters are long;
      they are always too short for my curiosity. I do not know that I
      was ever content with a single perusal.... My nights are grown
      again very uneasy <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg054" id=
      "pg054">054</a></span> and troublesome. I know not that the
      country will mend them; but I hope your company will mend my
      days. Though I cannot now expect much attention, and would not
      wish for more than can be spared from the poor dear lady (her
      mother), yet I shall see you and hear you every now and then; and
      to see and hear you, is always to hear wit, and to see virtue."

    <p>
      He would not suffer her to be lightly spoken of in his presence,
      nor permit his name to be coupled jocularly with hers. "I
      yesterday told him," says Boswell, when they were traversing the
      Highlands, "I was thinking of writing a poetical letter to him,
      on his return from Scotland, in the style of Swift's humorous
      epistle in the character of Mary Gulliver to her husband, Captain
      Lemuel Gulliver, on his return to England from the country of the
      Houyhnhnms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">

        "'At early morn I to the market haste,

      </p>
      <p>
        A curious <i>fowl</i> and <i>sparagrass</i> I chose;

    <p>
      He laughed, and asked in whose name I would write it. I said in
      Mrs. Thrale's. He was angry. 'Sir, if you have any sense of
      decency or delicacy, you won't do that.' <i>Boswell</i>. 'Then
      let it be in Cole's, the landlord of the Mitre tavern, where we
      have so often sat together.' <i>Johnson</i>. 'Ay, that may do.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, at Inverary, when Johnson called for a gill of whiskey
      that he might know what makes a Scotchman <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg055" id="pg055">055</a></span> happy, and
      Boswell proposed Mrs. Thrale as their toast, he would not have
      <i>her</i> drunk in whiskey. Peter Pindar has maliciously added
      to this reproof:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">

        "We supped most royally, were vastly frisky,

      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the glass, says I, 'Here's Mistress Thrale,'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Drink her in <i>whiskey</i> not,' said he, 'but <i>ale</i>.'"
      </p>

    <p>
      So far from making light of her scholarship, he frequently
      accepted her as a partner in translations from the Latin. The
      translations from Boethius, printed in the second volume of the
      Letters, are their joint composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      After recapitulating Johnson's other contributions to literature
      in 1766, Boswell says, "'The Fountains,' a beautiful little fairy
      tale in prose, written with exquisite simplicity, is one of
      Johnson's productions; and I cannot withhold from Mrs. Thrale the
      praise of being the author of that admirable poem 'The Three
      Warnings.'" <i>Marginal note</i>: "How sorry he is!" Both the
      tale and the poem were written for a collection of
      "Miscellanies," published by Mrs. Williams in that year. The
      character of Floretta in "The Fountains" was intended for Mrs.
      Thrale, and she thus gracefully alludes to it in a letter to
      Johnson in Feb. 1782:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The newspapers would spoil my few comforts that are left if they
      could; but you tell me that's only because I have the reputation,
      whether true or false, of being a <i>wit</i> forsooth; and you
      remember <i>poor Floretta</i>, who was teased into wishing away
      her spirit, her <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg056" id=
      "pg056">056</a></span> beauty, her fortune, and at last even her
      life, never could bear the bitter water which was to have washed
      away her wit; which she resolved to keep with all its
      consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fugitive pieces, mostly in verse, thrown off from time to
      time at all periods of her life, are numerous; and the best of
      them that have been recovered will be included in these volumes.
      In a letter to the author of "Piozziana," she says:&mdash;"When
      Wilkes and Liberty were at their highest tide, I was bringing or
      losing children every year; and my studies were confined to my
      nursery; so, it came into my head one day to send an infant
      alphabet to the 'St. James Chronicle':&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'A was an Alderman, factious and proud;

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "In a week's time Dr. Johnson asked me if I knew who wrote it?
      'Why, who did write it, Sir?' said I. 'Steevens,' was the reply.
      Some time after that, years for aught I know, he mentioned to me
      Steevens's veracity! 'No, no;' answered H.L.P., anything but
      that;' and told my story; showing him by incontestable proofs
      that it was mine. Johnson did not utter a word, and we never
      talked about it any more. I durst not introduce the subject; but
      it served to hinder S. from visiting at the house: I suppose
      Johnson kept him away."
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not appear that Steevens claimed the Alphabet; which may
      have suggested the celebrated squib that appeared in the "New
      Whig Guide," and was <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg057" id=
      "pg057">057</a></span> popularly attributed to Mr. Croker. It was
      headed "The Political Alphabet; or, the Young Member's A B C,"

      d'Arblay, who alludes to them complacently, thought them his; but
      he subsequently repudiated the authorship, and the editor of her

      These lines merit attention for the sake of the comparison they
      invite. An outcry has recently been raised against the laxity of
      modern fashion, in permitting venal beauty to receive open homage
      in our parks and theatres, and to be made the subject of prurient
      gossip by maids and matrons who should ignore its existence. But
      we need not look far beneath the surface of social history to
      discover that the irregularity in question is only a partial
      revival of the practice of our grandfathers and grandmothers,
      much as a crinoline may be regarded as a modified reproduction of
      the hoop. Junius thus denounces the Duke of Grafton's indecorous
      devotion to Nancy Parsons: "It is not the private indulgence, but
      the public insult, of which I complain. The name of Miss Parsons
      would hardly have been known, if the First Lord of the Treasury
      had not led her in triumph through the Opera House, even in the
      presence of the Queen." Lord March (afterwards Duke of
      Queensberry) was a lord of the bedchamber in the decorous court
      of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg060" id=
      "pg060">060</a></span> George the Third, when he wrote thus to
      Selwyn: "I was prevented from writing to you last Friday, by
      being at Newmarket with my little girl (Signora Zamperini, a
      noted dancer and singer). I had the whole family and Cocchi. The
      beauty went with me in my chaise, and the rest in the old
      landau."

      We have had Boswell's impression of his first visit to Streatham;
      and Madame D'Arblay's account of hers confirms the notion that My
      Mistress, not My Master, was the presiding genius of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>London, August</i> (1778).&mdash;I have now to write an
      account of the most consequential day I have spent since my
      birth: namely, my Streatham visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our journey to Streatham was the least pleasant part of the day,
      for the roads were dreadfully dusty, and I was really in the
      fidgets from thinking what my reception might be, and from
      fearing they would expect a less awkward and backward kind of
      person than I was sure they would find.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Thrale's house is white, and very pleasantly situated, in a
      fine paddock. Mrs. Thrale was strolling about, and came to us as
      we got out of the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She then received me, taking both my hands, and with mixed
      politeness and cordiality welcomed me to Streatham. She led me
      into the house, and addressed herself almost wholly for a few
      minutes to my father, as if to give me an assurance she did not
      mean to regard me as a show, or to distress or frighten me by
      drawing me out. Afterwards she took me up stairs, and showed me
      the house, and said she had very much <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg061" id="pg061">061</a></span> wished to see
      me at Streatham, and should always think herself much obliged to
      Dr. Burney for his goodness in bringing me, which she looked upon
      as a very great favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But though we were some time together, and though she was so
      very civil, she did not <i>hint</i> at my book, and I love her
      much more than ever for her delicacy in avoiding a subject which
      she could not but see would have greatly embarrassed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we returned to the music-room, we found Miss Thrale was
      with my father. Miss Thrale is a very fine girl, about fourteen
      years of age, but cold and reserved, though full of knowledge and
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon after, Mrs. Thrale took me to the library; she talked a
      little while upon common topics, and then, at last, she mentioned
      'Evelina.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I now prevailed upon Mrs. Thrale to let me amuse myself, and she
      went to dress. I then prowled about to choose some book, and I
      saw, upon the reading-table, 'Evelina.' I had just fixed upon a
      new translation of Cicero's 'Lælius,' when the library door was
      opened, and Mr. Seward entered. I instantly put away my book,
      because I dreaded being thought studious and affected. He offered
      his service to find anything for me, and then, in the same
      breath, ran on to speak of the book with which I had myself
      'favoured the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The exact words he began with I cannot recollect, for I was
      actually confounded by the attack; and his abrupt manner of
      letting me know he was <i>au fait</i> <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg062" id="pg062">062</a></span> equally
      astonished and provoked me. How different from the delicacy of
      Mr. and Mrs. Thrale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A high French authority has laid down that good breeding consists
      in rendering to all what is socially their due. This definition
      is imperfect. Good breeding is best displayed by putting people
      at their ease; and Mrs. Thrale's manner of putting the young
      authoress at her ease was the perfection of delicacy and tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Johnson's entrance on the stage had been premeditated, it
      could hardly have been more dramatically ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we were summoned to dinner, Mrs. Thrale made my father and
      me sit on each side of her. I said that I hoped I did not take
      Dr. Johnson's place;&mdash;for he had not yet appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' answered Mrs. Thrale, 'he will sit by you, which I am sure
      will give him great pleasure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon after we were seated, this great man entered. I have so
      true a veneration for him, that the very sight of him inspires me
      with delight and reverence, notwithstanding the cruel infirmities
      to which he is subject; for he has almost perpetual convulsive
      movements, either of his hands, lips, feet, or knees, and
      sometimes of all together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale introduced me to him, and he took his place. We had
      a noble dinner, and a most elegant dessert. Dr. Johnson, in the
      middle of dinner, asked Mrs. Thrale what was in some little pies
      that were near him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg063" id=
      "pg063">063</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mutton,' answered she, 'so I don't ask you to eat any, because
      I know you despise it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, Madam, no,' cried he: 'I despise nothing that is good of
      its sort; but I am too proud now to eat of it. Sitting by Miss
      Burney makes me very proud to-day!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Miss Burney,' said Mrs. Thrale, laughing, 'you must take great
      care of your heart if Dr. Johnson attacks it; for I assure you he
      is not often successless.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's that you say, Madam?' cried he; 'are you making mischief
      between the young lady and me already?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little while after he drank Miss Thrale's health and mine, and
      then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a terrible thing that we cannot wish young ladies well,
      without wishing them to become old women.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay's memoirs are sadly defaced by egotism, and
      gratified vanity may have had a good deal to do with her
      unqualified admiration of Mrs. Thrale; for "Evelina" (recently
      published) was the unceasing topic of exaggerated eulogy during
      the entire visit. Still so acute an observer could not be
      essentially wrong in an account of her reception, which is in the
      highest degree favourable to her newly acquired friend. Of her
      second visit she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our journey was charming. The kind Mrs. Thrale would give
      courage to the most timid. She did not ask me questions, or
      catechise me upon what I knew, or use any means to draw me out,
      but made it her <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg064" id=
      "pg064">064</a></span> business to draw herself out&mdash;that
      is, to start subjects, to support them herself, and take all the
      weight of the conversation, as if it behoved her to find me
      entertainment. But I am so much in love with her, that I shall be
      obliged to run away from the subject, or shall write of nothing
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we arrived here, Mrs. Thrale showed me my room, which is an
      exceeding pleasant one, and then conducted me to the library,
      there to divert myself while she dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Thrale soon joined me: and I begin to like her. Mr. Thrale
      was neither well nor in spirits all day. Indeed, he seems not to
      be a happy man, though he has every means of happiness in his
      power. But I think I have rarely seen a very rich man with a
      light heart and light spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      The concluding remark, coming from such a source, may supply an
      improving subject of meditation or inquiry; if found true, it may
      help to suppress envy and promote contentment. Thrale's state of
      health, however, accounts for his depression independently of his
      wealth, which rested on too precarious a foundation to allow of
      unbroken confidence and gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At tea (continues the diarist) we all met again, and Dr. Johnson
      was gaily sociable. He gave a very droll account of the children
      of Mr. Langton&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Who,' he said, 'might be very good children if they were let
      alone; but the father is never easy when he is not making them do
      something which they cannot do; they must repeat a fable, or a
      speech, or the Hebrew <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg065" id=
      "pg065">065</a></span> alphabet; and they might as well count
      twenty, for what they know of the matter: however, the father
      says half, for he prompts every other word. But he could not have
      chosen a man who would have been less entertained by such means.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I believe not!' cried Mrs. Thrale: 'nothing is more ridiculous
      than parents cramming their children's nonsense down other
      people's throats. I keep mine as much out of the way as I can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yours, Madam,' answered he, 'are in nobody's way; no children
      can be better managed or less troublesome; but your fault is, a
      too great perverseness in not allowing anybody to give them
      anything. Why should they not have a cherry, or a gooseberry, as
      well as bigger children?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, the freedom with which Dr. Johnson condemns whatever he
      disapproves, is astonishing; and the strength of words he uses
      would, to most people, be intolerable; but Mrs. Thrale seems to
      have a sweetness of disposition that equals all her other
      excellences, and far from making a point of vindicating herself,
      she generally receives his admonitions with the most respectful
      silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it must not be supposed that this was done without an effort.
      When Boswell speaks of Johnson's "accelerating her pulsation,"
      she adds, "he checked it often enough, to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the conversations which occurred during this visit is
      characteristic of all parties:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had been talking of colours, and of the fantastic
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg066" id="pg066">066</a></span>
      names given to them, and why the palest lilac should be called a
      <i>soupir étouffé</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, Madam,' said he, with wonderful readiness, 'it is called a
      stifled sigh because it is checked in its progress, and only half
      a colour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not help expressing my amazement at his universal
      readiness upon all subjects, and Mrs. Thrale said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sir, Miss Burney wonders at your patience with such stuff; but
      I tell her you are used to me, for I believe I torment you with
      more foolish questions than anybody else dares do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, Madam,' said he, 'you don't torment me;&mdash;you teaze me,
      indeed, sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ay, so I do, Dr. Johnson, and I wonder you bear with my
      nonsense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, Madam, you never talk nonsense; you have as much sense, and
      more wit, than any woman I know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh,' cried Mrs. Thrale, blushing, 'it is my turn to go under
      the table this morning, Miss Burney!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And yet,' continued the Doctor, with the most comical look, 'I
      have known all the wits, from Mrs. Montagu down to Bet Flint!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bet Flint,' cried Mrs. Thrale; 'pray who is she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, a fine character, Madam! She was habitually a slut and a
      drunkard, and occasionally a thief and a harlot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And, for heaven's sake, how came you to know her?' <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg067" id="pg067">067</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, Madam, she figured in the literary world, too! Bet Flint
      wrote her own life, and called herself Cassandra, and it was in
      verse. So Bet brought me her verses to correct; but I gave her a
      half-a-crown, and she liked it as well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And pray what became of her, Sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, Madam, she stole a quilt from the man of the house, and he
      had her taken up: but Bet Flint had a spirit not to be subdued;
      so when she found herself obliged to go to jail, she ordered a
      sedan chair, and bid her footboy walk before her. However, the
      boy proved refractory, for he was ashamed, though his mistress
      was not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And did she ever get out of jail again, Sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes, Madam; when she came to her trial, the judge acquitted
      her. "So now," she said to me, "the quilt is my own, and now I'll
      make a petticoat of it."<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Oh, I
      loved Bet Flint!'

      Madame D'Arblay's notes (in her Diary) of the conversation and
      mode of life at Streatham are full and spirited, and exhibit
      Johnson in moods and situations in which he was seldom seen by
      Boswell. The adroitness with which he divided his attentions
      amongst the ladies, blending approval with instruction, and
      softening contradiction <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg068" id=

      Sir Henry Bulwer (in his "France") says that Louis the Fourteenth
      was entitled to be called a man of genius, if only from the
      delicate beauty of his compliments. Mrs. Thrale awards the palm
      of excellence in the same path to Johnson. "Your compliments,
      Sir, are made seldom, but when they are made, they have an
      elegance unequalled; but then, when you are angry, who dares make
      speeches so bitter and so cruel?" "I am sure," she adds, after a
      semblance of defence on his part, "I have had my share of
      scolding from you." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg069" id=

      you have borne it like an angel, and you have been the better for
      it." As the discussion proceeds, he accuses her of often
      provoking him to say severe things by unreasonable commendation;
      a common mode of acquiring a character for amiability at the
      expense of one's intimates, who are made to appear uncharitable
      by being thus constantly placed on the depreciating side.

    <p>
      Some years prior to this period (1778) Mrs. Thrale's mind and
      character had undergone a succession of the most trying ordeals,
      and was tempered and improved, without being hardened, by them.
      In allusion to what she suffered in child-bearing, she said later
      in life that she had nine times undergone the sentence of a
      convict,&mdash;confinement with hard labour. Child after child
      died at the age when the bereavement is most affecting to a
      mother. Her husband's health kept her in a constant state of
      apprehension for his life, and his affairs became embarrassed to
      the very verge of bankruptcy. So long as they remained
      prosperous, he insisted on her not meddling with them in any way,
      and even required her to keep to her drawing-room and leave the
      conduct of their domestic establishment to the butler and
      housekeeper. But when (from circumstances detailed in the
      "Autobiography") his fortune was seriously endangered, he wisely
      and gladly availed himself of her prudence and energy, and was
      saved by so doing. I have now before me a collection of autograph
      letters from her to Mr. Perkins, then manager and afterwards one
      of the proprietors of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg070" id=
      "pg070">070</a></span> the brewery, from which it appears that
      she paid the most minute attention to the business, besides
      undertaking the superintendence of her own hereditary estate in
      Wales. On September 28, 1773, she writes to Mr. Perkins, who was
      on a commercial journey:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Thrale is still upon his little tour; I opened a letter from
      you at the counting-house this morning, and am sorry to find you
      have so much trouble with Grant and his affairs. How glad I shall
      be to hear that matter is settled at all to your satisfaction.
      His letter and remittance came while I was there to-day....
      Careless, of the 'Blue Posts,' has turned refractory, and applied
      to Hoare's people, who have sent him in their beer. I called on
      him to-day, however, and by dint of an unwearied solicitation,
      (for I kept him at the coach side a full half-hour) I got his
      order for six butts more as the final trial."
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of fine ladies pressing tradesmen for their votes with
      compromising importunity are far from rare, but it would be
      difficult to find a parallel for Johnson's Hetty doing duty as a
      commercial traveller. She was simultaneously obliged to
      anticipate the electioneering exploits of the Duchess of
      Devonshire and Mrs. Crewe; and in after life, having occasion to
      pass through Southwark, she expresses her astonishment at no
      longer recognising a place, every hole and corner of which she
      had three times visited as a canvasser.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of Mr. Thrale, a friend of Mr. H. Thornton
      canvassed the borough on behalf of that gentleman. He waited on
      Mrs. Thrale, who promised her <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg071" id="pg071">071</a></span> support. She concluded her
      obliging expressions by saying:&mdash;"I wish your friend
      success, and I think he will have it: he may probably come in for
      two parliaments, but if he tries for a third, were he an angel
      from heaven, the people of Southwark would cry, 'Not <i>this</i>
      man, but Barabbas.'"<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Miss Laetitia Matilda Hawkins vouches for this
        story.&mdash;"Memoir, &amp;c." vol. i. p.66, note, where she
        adds:&mdash;"I have heard it said, that into whatever company
        she (Mrs. T.) fell, she could be the most agreeable person in
        it."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      On one of her canvassing expeditions, Johnson accompanied her,
      and a rough fellow, a hatter by trade, seeing the moralist's hat
      in a state of decay, seized it suddenly with one hand, and
      clapping him on the back with the other, cried out, "Ah, Master
      Johnson, this is no time to be thinking about hats." "No, no,
      Sir," replied the Doctor, "hats are of no use now, as you say,
      except to throw up in the air and huzzah with;" accompanying his
      words with the true election halloo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrale had serious thoughts of repaying Johnson's electioneering
      aid in kind, by bringing him into Parliament. Sir John Hawkins
      says that Thrale had two meetings with the minister (Lord North),
      who at first seemed inclined to find Johnson a seat, but
      eventually discountenanced the project. Lord Stowell told Mr.
      Croker that Lord North did not feel quite sure that Johnson's
      support might not sometimes prove rather an incumbrance than a
      help. "His lordship perhaps thought, and not unreasonably, that,
      like the elephant <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg072" id=
      "pg072">072</a></span> in the battle, he was quite as likely to
      trample down his friends as his foes." Flood doubted whether
      Johnson, being long used to sententious brevity and the short
      flights of conversation, would have succeeded in the expanded
      kind of argument required in public speaking. Burke's opinion
      was, that if he had come early into Parliament, he would have
      been the greatest speaker ever known in it. Upon being told this
      by Reynolds, he exclaimed, "I should like to try my hand now." On
      Boswell's adding that he wished he <i>had</i>, Mrs. Thrale
      writes: "Boswell had leisure for curiosity: Ministers had not.
      Boswell would have been equally amused by his failure as by his
      success; but to Lord North there would have been no joke at all
      in the experiment ending untowardly."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was equally ready with advice and encouragement during the
      difficulties connected with the brewery. He was not of opinion
      with Aristotle and Parson Adams, that trade is below a
      philosopher<span class="fnref">[1]</span>; and he eagerly buried
      himself in computing the cost of the malt and the possible
      profits on the ale. In October 1772, he writes from Lichfield:
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "Trade, answered Adams, is below a philosopher, as
        Aristotle proves in his first chapter of 'Politics,' and
        unnatural, as it is managed now."&mdash;<i>Joseph Andrews</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Do not suffer little things to disturb you. The brew-house must
      be the scene of action, and the subject of speculation. The first
      consequence of our late trouble ought to be, an endeavour to brew
      at a cheaper rate; an endeavour not violent and transient, but
      steady and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg073" id=
      "pg073">073</a></span> continual, prosecuted with total contempt
      of censure or wonder, and animated by resolution not to stop
      while more can be done. Unless this can be done, nothing can help
      us; and if this be done, we shall not want help. Surely there is
      something to be saved; there is to be saved whatever is the
      difference between vigilance and neglect, between parsimony and
      profusion. The price of malt has risen again. It is now two
      pounds eight shillings the quarter. Ale is sold in the
      public-houses at sixpence a quart, a price which I never heard of
      before."

    <p class="break">
      In November of the same year, from Ashbourne:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR MADAM,&mdash;So many days and never a
      letter!&mdash;<i>Fugere fides, pietasque pudorque</i>. This is
      Turkish usage. And I have been hoping and hoping. But you are so
      glad to have me out of your mind.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you were quite right in your advice about the thousand
      pounds, for the payment could not have been delayed long; and a
      short delay would have lessened credit, without advancing
      interest. But in great matters you are hardly ever mistaken."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] This tone of playful reproach, when adopted by Johnson at a
        later period, has been cited as a proof of actual
        ill-treatment.

    <p class="break">
      In May 17, 1773:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; suppose, that what I took the
      liberty of suggesting was concerted with you? He does not know
      how much I revolve his affairs, and how honestly I desire his
      prosperity. I hope he has let the hint take some hold of his
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the copy of the printed letters presented by Mrs. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg074" id="pg074">074</a></span> Thrale to Sir
      James Fellowes, the blank is filled up with the name of Thrale,
      and the passage is thus annotated in her handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Concerning his (Thrale's) connection with quack chemists, quacks
      of all sorts; jumping up in the night to go to Marlbro' Street
      from Southwark, after some advertising mountebank, at hazard of
      his life," In "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "18<i>th July</i>, 1778.&mdash;Mr. Thrale overbrewed himself last
      winter and made an artificial scarcity of money in the family
      which has extremely lowered his spirits. Mr. Johnson endeavoured
      last night, and so did I, to make him promise that he would never
      more brew a larger quantity of beer in one winter than 80,000
      barrels<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, but my Master, mad with
      the noble ambition of emulating Whitbread and Calvert, two
      fellows that he despises,&mdash;could scarcely be prevailed on to
      promise even <i>this</i>, that he will not brew more than four
      score thousand barrels a year for five years to come. He did
      promise that much, however; and so Johnson bade me write it down
      in the 'Thraliana';&mdash;and so the wings of Speculation are
      clipped a little&mdash;very fain would I have pinioned her, but I
      had not strength to perform the operation."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "If he got but <i>2s. 6d.</i> by each barrel, 80,000 half
        crowns are £10,000; and what more would mortal man desire than
        an income of ten thousand a year&mdash;five to spend, and five
        to lay up?"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      That Johnson's advice was neither thrown away nor undervalued,
      may be inferred from an incident related by Boswell. Mr. Perkins
      had hung up in the counting-house <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg075" id="pg075">075</a></span> a fine proof of the mezzotinto
      of Dr. Johnson by Doughty; and when Mrs. Thrale asked him,
      somewhat flippantly, "Why do you put him up in the
      counting-house?" Mr. Perkins answered, "Because, Madam, I wish to
      have one wise man there." "Sir," said Johnson, "I thank you. It
      is a very handsome compliment, and I believe you speak
      sincerely."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in the habit of paying the most minute attention to every
      branch of domestic economy, and his suggestions are invariably
      marked by shrewdness and good sense. Thus when Mrs. Thrale was
      giving evening parties, he told her that though few people might
      be hungry after a late dinner, she should always have a good
      supply of cakes and sweetmeats on a side table, and that some
      cold meat and a bottle of wine would often be found acceptable.
      Notwithstanding the imperfection of his eyesight, and his own
      slovenliness, he was a critical observer of dress and demeanour,
      and found fault without ceremony or compunction when any of his
      canons of taste or propriety were infringed. Several amusing
      examples are enumerated by Mrs. Thrale:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I commended a young lady for her beauty and pretty behaviour one
      day, however, to whom I thought no objections could have been
      made. 'I saw her,' said Dr. Johnson, 'take a pair of scissors in
      her left hand though; and for all her father is now become a
      nobleman, and as you say excessively rich, I should, were I a
      youth of quality ten years hence, hesitate between a girl so
      neglected, and a <i>negro</i>.' <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg076" id="pg076">076</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was indeed astonishing how he <i>could</i> remark such
      minuteness with a sight so miserably imperfect; but no accidental
      position of a riband escaped him, so nice was his observation,
      and so rigorous his demands of propriety. When I went with him to
      Litchfield, and came downstairs to breakfast at the inn, my dress
      did not please him, and he made me alter it entirely before he
      would stir a step with us about the town, saying most satirical
      things concerning the appearance I made in a riding-habit; and
      adding, ''Tis very strange that such eyes as yours cannot discern
      propriety of dress: if I had a sight only half as good, I think I
      should see to the centre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another lady, whose accomplishments he never denied, came to our
      house one day covered with diamonds, feathers, &amp;c., and he
      did not seem inclined to chat with her as usual. I asked him why?
      when the company was gone. 'Why, her head looked so like that of
      a woman who shows puppets,' said he, 'and her voice so confirmed
      the fancy, that I could not bear her to-day; when she wears a
      large cap, I can talk to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the ladies wore lace trimmings to their clothes, he
      expressed his contempt of the reigning fashion in these terms: 'A
      Brussels trimming is like bread-sauce,' said he, 'it takes away
      the glow of colour from the gown, and gives you nothing instead
      of it; but sauce was invented to heighten the flavour of our
      food, and trimming is an ornament to the manteau, or it is
      nothing. Learn,' said he, 'that there is propriety <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg077" id="pg077">077</a></span> or
      impropriety in every thing how slight soever, and get at the
      general principles of dress and of behaviour; if you then
      transgress them, you will at least know that they are not
      observed.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay confirms this account. He had just been finding
      fault with a bandeau worn by Lady Lade, a very large woman,
      standing six feet high without her shoes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J.</i>&mdash;The truth is, women, take them in general,
      have no idea of grace. Fashion is all they think of. I don't mean
      Mrs. Thrale and Miss Burney, when I talk of women!&mdash;they are
      goddesses!&mdash;and therefore I except them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mrs. Thrale.</i>&mdash;Lady Lade never wore the bandeau, and
      said she never would, because it is unbecoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J. (laughing.)</i>&mdash;Did not she? then is Lady Lade a
      charming woman, and I have yet hopes of entering into engagements
      with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mrs. T.</i>&mdash;Well, as to that I can't say; but to be
      sure, the only similitude I have yet discovered in you, is in
      size: there you agree mighty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J.</i>&mdash;Why, if anybody could have worn the bandeau,
      it must have been Lady Lade; for there is enough of her to carry
      it off; but you are too little for anything ridiculous; that
      which seems nothing upon a Patagonian, will become very
      conspicuous upon a Lilliputian, and of you there is so little in
      all, that one single absurdity would swallow up half of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Matrimony was one of his favourite subjects, and he was fond of
      laying down and refining on the duties of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg078" id="pg078">078</a></span> the married
      state, with the amount of happiness and comfort to be found in
      it. But once when he was musing over the fire in the drawing-room
      at Streatham, a young gentleman called to him suddenly, "Mr.
      Johnson, would you advise me to marry?" "I would advise no man to
      marry, Sir," replied the Doctor in a very angry tone, "who is not
      likely to propagate understanding;" and so left the room. "Our
      companion," adds Mrs. Thrale, in the "Anecdotes," "looked
      confounded, and I believe had scarce recovered the consciousness
      of his own existence, when Johnson came back, and, drawing his
      chair among us, with altered looks and a softened voice, joined
      in the general chat, insensibly led the conversation to the
      subject of marriage, where he laid himself out in a dissertation
      so useful, so elegant, so founded on the true knowledge of human
      life, and so adorned with beauty of sentiment, that no one ever
      recollected the offence, except to rejoice in its consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman was Mr. Thrale's nephew, Sir John Lade; who
      was proposed, half in earnest, whilst still a minor, by the
      Doctor as a fitting mate for the author of "Evelina." He married
      a woman of the town, became a celebrated member of the
      Four-in-Hand Club, and contrived to waste the whole of a fine
      fortune before he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      In "Thraliana" she says:&mdash;"Lady Lade consulted him about her
      son, Sir John. 'Endeavour, Madam,' said he, 'to procure him
      knowledge; for really ignorance to a rich man is like fat to a
      sick sheep, it only serves <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg079"
      id="pg079">079</a></span> to call the rooks about him.' On the
      same occasion it was that he observed how a mind unfurnished with
      subjects and materials for thinking can keep up no dignity at all
      in solitude. 'It is,' says he, 'in the state of a mill without
      grist.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The attractions of Streatham must have been very strong, to
      induce Johnson to pass so much of his time away from "the busy
      hum of men" in Fleet Street, and "the full tide of human
      existence" at Charing Cross. He often found fault with Mrs.
      Thrale for living so much in the country, "feeding the chickens
      till she starved her understanding." Walking in a wood when it
      rained, she tells us, "was the only rural image he pleased his
      fancy with; for he would say, after one has gathered the apples
      in an orchard, one wishes them well baked, and removed to a
      London eating-house for enjoyment." This is almost as bad as the
      foreigner, who complained that there was no ripe fruit in England
      but the roasted apples. Amongst other modes of passing time in
      the country, Johnson once or twice tried hunting and, mounted on
      an old horse of Mr. Thrale's, acquitted himself to the surprise
      of the "field," one of whom delighted him by exclaiming, "Why
      Johnson rides as well, for ought I see, as the most illiterate
      fellow in England." But a trial or two satisfied him&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
      </p>
      <p>
        Who after a long chase o'er hills, dales, fields,
      </p>
      <p>
        And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask'd next day,'If men ever hunted twice?'"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It is very strange, and very melancholy, was his reflection,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg080" id="pg080">080</a></span>
      that the paucity of human pleasures should persuade us ever to
      call hunting one of them. The mode of locomotion in which he
      delighted was the vehicular. As he was driving rapidly in a
      postchaise with Boswell, he exclaimed, "Life has not many things
      better than this." On their way from Dr. Taylor's to Derby in
      1777, he said, "If I had no duties, and no reference to futurity,
      I would spend my life in driving briskly in a postchaise with a
      pretty woman, but she should be one who could understand me, and
      would add something to the conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Croker attributes his enjoyment to the novelty of the
      pleasure; his poverty having in early life prevented him from
      travelling post. But a better reason is given by Mrs. Thrale:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked him why he doated on a coach so? and received for
      answer, that in the first place, the company were shut in with
      him <i>there</i>; and could not escape, as out of a room; in the
      next place, he heard all that was said in a carriage, where it
      was my turn to be deaf; and very impatient was he at my
      occasional difficulty of hearing. On this account he wished to
      travel all over the world: for the very act of going forward was
      delightful to him, and he gave himself no concern about
      accidents, which he said never happened; nor did the running-away
      of the horses at the edge of a precipice between Vernon and St.
      Denys in France convince him to the contrary: 'for nothing came
      of it,' he said, 'except that Mr. Thrale leaped out of the
      carriage into a chalk-pit, and then came up again, looking as
      <i>white</i>!' <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg081" id=
      "pg081">081</a></span> When the truth was, all their lives were
      saved by the greatest providence ever exerted in favour of three
      human creatures: and the part Mr. Thrale took from desperation
      was the likeliest thing in the world to produce broken limbs and
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawbacks on his gratification and on that of his fellow
      travellers were his physical defects, and his utter insensibility
      to the beauty of nature, as well as to the fine arts, in so far
      as they were addressed to the senses of sight and hearing. "He
      delighted," says Mrs. Thrale, "no more in music than painting; he
      was almost as deaf as he was blind; travelling with Dr. Johnson
      was, for these reasons, tiresome enough. Mr. Thrale loved
      prospects, and was mortified that his friend could not enjoy the
      sight of those different dispositions of wood and water, hill and
      valley, that travelling through England and France affords a man.
      But when he wished to point them out to his companion: 'Never
      heed such nonsense,' would be the reply: 'a blade of grass is
      always a blade of grass, whether in one country or another: let
      us, if we <i>do</i> talk, talk about something; men and women are
      my subjects of inquiry; let us see how these differ from those we
      have left behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no small deduction from our admiration of Johnson, and no
      trifling enhancement of his friends' kindness in tolerating his
      eccentricities, that he seldom made allowance for his own
      palpable and undeniable deficiencies. As well might a blind man
      deny the existence of colours, as a purblind man assert that
      there was no charm in a prospect, or in a Claude or <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg082" id="pg082">082</a></span> Titian,
      because he could see none. Once, by way of pleasing Reynolds, he
      pretended to lament that the great painter's genius was not
      exerted on stuff more durable than canvas, and suggested copper.
      Sir Joshua urged the difficulty of procuring plates large enough
      for historical subjects. "What foppish obstacles are these!"
      exclaimed Johnson. "Here is Thrale has a thousand ton of copper:
      you may paint it all round if you will, I suppose; it will serve
      him to brew in afterwards. Will it not, Sir?" (to Thrale, who
      sate by.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He always "civilised" to Dr. Burney, who has supplied the
      following anecdote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "After having talked slightingly of music, he was observed to
      listen very attentively while Miss Thrale played on the
      harpsichord; and with eagerness he called to her, 'Why don't you
      dash away like Burney?' Dr. Burney upon this said to him, 'I
      believe, Sir, we shall make a musician of you at last.' Johnson
      with candid complacency replied, 'Sir, I shall be glad to have a
      new sense given to me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1774, the Thrales made a tour in Wales, mainly for the purpose
      of revisiting her birthplace and estates. They were accompanied
      by Johnson, who kept a diary of the expedition, beginning July
      5th and ending September 24th. It was preserved by his negro
      servant, and Boswell had no suspicion of its existence, for he
      says, "I do not find that he kept any journal or notes of what he
      saw there." The diary was first published by Mr. Duppa in 1816;
      and some manuscript notes by Mrs. Thrale which reached that
      gentleman too late for <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg083" id=
      "pg083">083</a></span> insertion, have been added in Mr. Murray's
      recent edition of the Life. The first entry is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Tuesday, July 5</i>.&mdash;We left Streatham 11 A.M. Price of
      four horses two shillings a mile. Barnet 1.40 P.M. On the road I
      read 'Tully's Epistles.' At night at Dunstable." At Chester, he
      records:&mdash;"We walked round the walls, which are complete,
      and contain one mile, three quarters, and one hundred and one
      yards." Mrs. Thrale's comment is, "Of those ill-fated walls Dr.
      Johnson might have learned the extent from any one. He has since
      put me fairly out of countenance by saying, 'I have known <i>my
      mistress</i> fifteen years, and never saw her fairly out of
      humour but on Chester wall.' It was because he would keep Miss
      Thrale beyond her hour of going to bed to walk on the wall, where
      from the want of light, I apprehended some accident to her,
      perhaps to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      He thus describes Mrs. Thrale's family mansion:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Saturday, July 30.</i>&mdash;We went to Bâch y Graig, where
      we found an old house, built 1567, in an uncommon and
      incommodious form&mdash;My mistress chatted about tiring, but I
      prevailed on her to go to the top&mdash;The floors have been
      stolen: the windows are stopped&mdash;The house was less than I
      seemed to expect&mdash;The River Clwyd is a brook with a bridge
      of one arch, about one third of a mile&mdash;The woods have many
      trees, generally young; but some which seem to decay&mdash;They
      have been lopped&mdash;The house never had a garden&mdash;The
      addition of another story would make an useful house, but it
      cannot be great." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg084" id=
      "pg084">084</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 4th August, they visited Rhuddlan Castle and
      Bodryddan<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, of which he says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Now the property of Mr. Shipley Conway, the great-grandson
        of Johnson's acquaintance, the Bishop of St. Asaph, and
        representative, through females, of Sir John Conway or Conwy,
        to whom Rhuddlan Castle, with its domain, was granted by Edward
        the First.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Stapylton's house is pretty: there are pleasing shades about it,
      with a constant spring that supplies a cold bath. We then went
      out to see a cascade. I trudged unwillingly, and was not sorry to
      find it dry. The water was, however, turned on, and produced a
      very striking cataract."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Bowles, the poet, on the unexpected arrival of a party to
        see his grounds, was overheard giving a hurried order to set
        the fountain playing and carry the hermit his beard.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi remarks on this passage: "He teased Mrs. Cotton about
      her dry cascade till she was ready to cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cotton, <i>née</i> Stapylton, married the eldest son of Sir
      Lynch Cotton, and was the mother of Field-Marshal Viscount
      Combermere. She said that Johnson, despite of his rudeness, was
      at times delightful, having a manner peculiar to himself in
      relating anecdotes that could not fail to attract both old and
      young. Her impression was that Mrs. Thrale was very vexatious in
      wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much.
      This, I fancy, is no uncommon impression, when we ourselves are
      anxious to attract notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The range of hills bordering the valley or delta of the Clwyd, is
      very fine. On their being pointed out to him by his host, he
      exclaimed: "Hills, do you call <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg085" id="pg085">085</a></span> them?&mdash;mere mole-hills to
      the Alps or to those in Scotland." On being told that Sir Richard
      Clough had formed a plan for making the river navigable to
      Rhyddlan, he broke out into a loud fit of laughter, and
      shouted&mdash;"why, Sir, I could clear any part of it by a leap."
      He probably had seen neither the hills nor the river, which might
      easily be made navigable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On two occasions, Johnson incidentally imputes a want of
      liberality to Mrs. Thrale, which the general tenor of her conduct
      belies:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August 2.</i>&mdash;We went to Dymerchion Church, where the
      old clerk acknowledged his mistress. It is the parish church of
      Bâch y Graig; a mean fabric; Mr. Salusbury (Mrs. Thrale's father)
      was buried in it.... The old clerk had great appearance of joy,
      and foolishly said that he was now willing to die. He had only a
      crown given him by my mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August 4.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Thrale lost her purse. She expressed
      so much uneasiness that I concluded the sum to be very great; but
      when I heard of only seven guineas, I was glad to find she had so
      much sensibility of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson might have remarked, that the annoyance we experience
      from a loss is seldom entirely regulated by the pecuniary value
      of the thing lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to Holywell he sets down: "Talk with mistress about
      flattery;" on which she notes: "He said I flattered the people to
      whose houses we went: I was saucy and said I was obliged to be
      civil for two, meaning <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg086" id=
      "pg086">086</a></span> himself and me.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> He replied nobody would thank me for
      compliments they did not understand. At Gwanynog (Mr.
      Middleton's), however, <i>he</i> was flattered, and was happy of
      course."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Madame D'Arblay reports Mrs. Thrale saying to Johnson at
        Streatham, in September, 1778: "I remember, Sir, when we were
        travelling in Wales, how you called me to account for my
        civility to the people; 'Madam,' you said, 'let me have no more
        of this idle commendation of nothing. Why is it, that whatever
        you see, and whoever you see, you are to be so indiscriminately
        lavish of praise?' 'Why I'll tell you, Sir,' said I, 'when I am
        with you, and Mr. Thrale, and Queeny, I am obliged to be civil
        for four!'"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The other entries referring to the Thrales are:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August</i> 22.&mdash;We went to visit Bodville, the place
      where Mrs. Thrale was born, and the churches called Tydweilliog
      and Llangwinodyl, which she holds by impropriation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August</i> 24.&mdash;We went to see Bodville. Mrs. Thrale
      remembered the rooms, and wandered over them, with recollections
      of her childhood. This species of pleasure is always
      melancholy.... Mr. Thrale purposes to beautify the churches, and,
      if he prospers, will probably restore the tithes. Mrs. Thrale
      visited a house where she had been used to drink milk, which was
      left, with an estate of 200<i>l.</i> a year, by one Lloyd, to a
      married woman who lived with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August</i> 26.&mdash;<i>Note</i>. Queeny's goats, 149, I
      think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without Mr. Duppa's aid this last entry would be a puzzle for
      commentators. His note is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Thrale was near-sighted, and could not see the goats
      browsing on Snowdon, and he promised his <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg087" id="pg087">087</a></span> daughter, who
      was a child of ten years old, a penny for every goat she would
      show him, and Dr. Johnson kept the account; so that it appears
      her father was in debt to her one hundred and forty-nine pence.
      <i>Queeny</i> was an epithet, which had its origin in the
      nursery, by which (in allusion to <i>Queen</i> Esther) Miss
      Thrale (whose name was Esther) was always distinguished by
      Johnson." She was named, after her mother, Hester, not Esther.
    </p>
    <p>
      On September 13, Johnson sets down: "We came, to Lord Sandys', at
      Ombersley, where we were treated with great civility." It was
      here, as he told Mrs. Thrale, that for the only time in his life
      he had as much wall fruit as he liked; yet she says that he was
      in the habit of eating six or seven peaches before breakfast
      during the fruit season at Streatham. Swift was also fond of
      fruit: "observing (says Scott) that a gentleman in whose garden
      he walked with some friends, seemed to have no intention to
      request them to eat any, the Dean remarked that it was a saying
      of his dear grandmother:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'Always pull a peach
      </p>
      <p>
        When it is within your reach;'
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      and helping himself accordingly, his example was followed by the
      whole company." Thomson, the author of the "Castle of Indolence,"
      was once seen lounging round Lord Burlington's garden, with his
      hands in his waistcoat pockets, biting off the sunny sides of the
      peaches. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg088" id=
      "pg088">088</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's dislike to the Lyttletons was not abated by his visit
      to Hagley, of which he says, "We made haste away from a place
      where all were offended." Mrs. Thrale's explanation is: "Mrs.
      Lyttelton, <i>ci-devant</i> Caroline Bristow, forced me to play
      at whist against my liking, and her husband took away Johnson's
      candle that he wanted to read by at the other end of the room.
      Those, I trust, were the offences."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not in much better humour at Combermere Abbey, the seat of
      her relative, Sir Lynch Cotton, which is beautifully situated on
      one of the finest lakes in England. He commends the place
      grudgingly, passes a harsh judgment on Lady Cotton, and is
      traditionally recorded to have made answer to the baronet who
      inquired what he thought of a neighbouring peer (Lord Kilmorey):
      "A dull, commonplace sort of man, just like you and your
      brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter to Levet, dated Lleweny, in Denbighshire, August 16,
      1774, printed by Boswell, is this sentence: "Wales, so far as I
      have yet seen of it, is a very beautiful and rich country, all
      enclosed and planted." Her marginal note is: "Yet to please Mr.
      Thrale, he feigned abhorrence of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      I am indebted to an intelligent and accurate in-formant for a
      curious incident of the Welsh tour:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Johnson was taken by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale to dine at
      Maesnynan, with my relation, Mr. Lloyd, who, with his pretty
      young daughter (motherless), received them at the door. All came
      out of the carriage except the great lexicographer, who was
      crouching in what <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg089" id=
      "pg089">089</a></span> my uncle jokingly called the Poets'
      Corner, deeply interested evidently with the book he was reading.
      A wink from Mrs. Thrale, and a touch of her hand, silenced the
      host. She bade the coachman not move, and desired the people in
      the house to let Mr. Johnson read on till dinner was on the
      table, when she would go and whistle him to it. She always had a
      whistle hung at her girdle, and this she used, when in Wales, to
      summon him and her daughters<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, when
      in or out of doors. Mr. Lloyd and all the visitors went to see
      the effect of the whistle, and found him reading intently with
      one foot on the step of the carriage, where he had been (a
      looker-on said) five minutes."

      whose brother, Colonel Thomas Lloyd, of the Guards, was the
      Brummell of his day, celebrated for his manly beauty and
      accomplishments. I heard Lord Crewe say that Colonel Lloyd's
      horse, and his graceful manner of mounting him, used to attract
      members of both Houses (he among them) to <i>turn out</i> to see
      him mount guard; and the Princesses were forbidden, when driving

      Their impressions of one another as travelling companions were
      sufficiently favourable to induce the party <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg090" id="pg090">090</a></span> (with the
      addition of Baretti) to make a short tour in France in the autumn
      of the year following, 1775, during part of which Johnson kept a
      diary in the same laconic and elliptical style. The only allusion
      to either of his friends is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We went to Sansterre, a brewer. He brews with about as much malt
      as Mr. Thrale, and sells his beer at the same price, though he
      pays no duty for malt, and little more than half as much for
      beer. Beer is sold retail at sixpence a bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter to Levet, dated Paris, Oct. 22, 1775, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We went to see the king and queen at dinner, and the queen was
      so impressed by Miss, that she sent one of the gentlemen to
      inquire who she was. I find all true that you have ever told me
      at Paris. Mr. Thrale is very liberal, and keeps us two coaches,
      and a very fine table; but I think our cookery very bad. Mrs.
      Thrale got into a convent of English nuns, and I talked with her
      through the grate, and I am very kindly used by the English
      Benedictine friars."
    </p>
    <p>
      A striking instance of Johnson's occasional impracticability
      occurred during this journey:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we were at Rouen together," says Mrs. Thrale, "he took a
      great fancy to the Abbe Kofiette, with whom he conversed about
      the destruction of the order of Jesuits, and condemned it loudly,
      as a blow to the general power of the church, and likely to be
      followed with many and dangerous innovations, which might at
      length become fatal to religion itself, and shake even
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg091" id="pg091">091</a></span>
      the foundation of Christianity. The gentleman seemed to wonder
      and delight in his conversation: the talk was all in Latin, which
      both spoke fluently, and Mr. Johnson pronounced a long eulogium
      upon Milton with so much ardour, eloquence, and ingenuity, that
      the abbé rose from his seat and embraced him. My husband seeing
      them apparently so charmed with the company of each other,
      politely invited the abbé to England, intending to oblige his
      friend; who, instead of thanking, reprimanded him severely before
      the man, for such a sudden burst of tenderness towards a person
      he could know nothing at all of; and thus put a sudden finish to
      all his own and Mr. Thrale's entertainment from the company of
      the Abbé Roffette."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter dated May 9, 1780, also, Mrs. Thrale alludes to more
      than one disagreement in France:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did I ever plague you about contour, and grace, and
      expression? I have dreaded them all three since that hapless day
      at Compiegne, when you teased me so, and Mr. Thrale made what I
      hoped would have proved a lasting peace; but French ground is
      unfavourable to fidelity perhaps, and so now you begin again:
      after having taken five years' breath, you might have done more
      than this. Say another word, and I will bring up afresh the
      history of your exploits at St. Denys and how cross you were for
      nothing&mdash;but some how or other, our travels never make any
      part either of our conversation or correspondence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Baretti, who now formed one of the family, is so mixed up
      with their history that some account <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg092" id="pg092">092</a></span> of him
      becomes indispensable. He was a Piedmontese, whose position in
      his native country was not of a kind to tempt him to remain in
      it, when Lord Charlemont, to whom he had been useful in Italy,
      proposed his coming to England. His own story was that he had
      lost at play the little property he had inherited from his
      father, an architect. The education given him by his parents was
      limited to Latin; he taught himself English, French, Spanish, and
      Portuguese. His talents, acquirements, and strength of mind must
      have been considerable, for they soon earned him the esteem and
      friendship of the most eminent members of the Johnsonian circle,
      in despite of his arrogance. He came to England in 1753; is
      kindly mentioned in one of Johnson's letters in 1754; and when he
      was in Italy in 1761, his illustrious friend's letters to him are
      marked by a tone of affectionate interest. Ceremony and
      tenderness are oddly blended in the conclusion of one of them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "May you, my Baretti, be very happy at Milan, or some other place
      nearer to, Sir, your most affectionate humble servant, SAMUEL
      JOHNSON."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson remarked of Baretti in 1768: "I know no man who carries
      his head higher in conversation than Baretti. There are strong
      powers in his mind. He has not indeed many hooks, but with what
      hooks he has, he grapples very forcibly." Cornelia Knight was
      "disgusted by his satirical madness of manner," although
      admitting him to be a man of great learning and information.
      Madame D'Arblay was more struck <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg093" id="pg093">093</a></span> by his rudeness and violence
      than by his intellectual vigour. "Thraliana" confirms Johnson's
      estimate of Baretti's capacity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will. Burke was tart upon Mr. Baretti for being too dogmatical
      in his talk about politics. 'You have,' says he, 'no business to
      be investigating the characters of Lord Falkland or Mr. Hampden.
      You cannot judge of their merits, they are no countrymen of
      yours.' 'True,' replied Baretti, 'and you should learn by the
      same rule to speak very cautiously about Brutus and Mark Antony;
      they are my countrymen, and I must have their characters tenderly
      treated by foreigners.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baretti could not endure to be called, or scarcely thought, a
      foreigner, and indeed it did not often occur to his company that
      he was one; for his accent was wonderfully proper, and his
      language always copious, always nervous, always full of various
      allusions, flowing too with a rapidity worthy of admiration, and
      far beyond the power of nineteen in twenty natives. He had also a
      knowledge of the solemn language and the gay, could be sublime
      with Johnson, or blackguard with the groom; could dispute, could
      rally, could quibble, in our language. Baretti has, besides, some
      skill in music, with a bass voice, very agreeable, besides a
      falsetto which he can manage so as to mimic any singer he hears.
      I would also trust his knowledge of painting a long way. These
      accomplishments, with his extensive power over every modern
      language, make him a most pleasing companion while he is in good
      humour; and his lofty consciousness of his own superiority, which
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg094" id="pg094">094</a></span>
      made him tenacious of every position, and drew him into a
      thousand distresses, did not, I must own, ever disgust me, till
      he began to exercise it against myself, and resolve to reign in
      our house by fairly defying the mistress of it. Pride, however,
      though shocking enough, is never despicable, but vanity, which he
      possessed too, in an eminent degree, will sometimes make a man
      near sixty ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "France displayed all Mr. Baretti's useful powers&mdash;he
      bustled for us, he catered for us, he took care of the child, he
      secured an apartment for the maid, he provided for our safety,
      our amusement, our repose; without him the pleasure of that
      journey would never have balanced the pain. And great was his
      disgust, to be sure, when he caught us, as he often did,
      ridiculing French manners, French sentiments, &amp;c. I think he
      half cryed to Mrs. Payne, the landlady at Dover, on our return,
      because we laughed at French cookery, and French accommodations.
      Oh, how he would court the maids at the inns abroad, abuse the
      men perhaps! and that with a facility not to be exceeded, as they
      all confessed, by any of the natives. But so he could in Spain, I
      find, and so 'tis plain he could here. I will give one instance
      of his skill in our low street language. Walking in a field near
      Chelsea, he met a fellow, who, suspecting him from dress and
      manner to be a foreigner, said sneeringly, 'Come, Sir, will you
      show me the way to France?' 'No, Sir,' says Baretti, instantly,
      'but I will show you the way to Tyburn.' Such, however, was his
      ignorance in a certain line, that he once asked Johnson for
      information <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg095" id=
      "pg095">095</a></span> who it was composed the Pater Noster, and
      I heard him tell Evans<span class="fnref">[1]</span> the story of
      Dives and Lazarus as the subject of a poem he once had composed
      in the Milanese dialect, expecting great credit for his powers of
      invention. Evans owned to me that he thought the man drunk,
      whereas poor Baretti was, both in eating and drinking, a model of
      temperance. Had he guessed Evans's thoughts, the parson's gown
      would scarcely have saved him a knouting from the ferocious
      Italian."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Evans was a clergyman and rector of Southwark.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      On Oct. 20, 1769, Baretti was tried at the Old Bailey on a charge
      of murder, for killing with a pocket knife one of three men who,
      with a woman of the town, hustled him in the
      Haymarket.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> He was acquitted, and
      the event is principally memorable for the appearance of Johnson,
      Burke, Grarrick, and Beauclerc as witnesses to character. The
      substance of Johnson's evidence is thus given in the "Gentleman's
      Magazine":
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] In his defence, he said:&mdash;"I hope it will be seen that
        my knife was neither a weapon of offence or defence. I wear it
        to carve fruit and sweetmeats, and not to kill my fellow
        creatures. It is a general custom in France not to put knives
        on the table, so that even ladies wear them in their pockets
        for general use."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "<i>Dr. J</i>.&mdash;I believe I began to be acquainted with Mr.
      Baretti about the year 1753 or 1754. I have been intimate with
      him. He is a man of literature, a very studious man, a man of
      great diligence. He gets his living by study. I have no reason to
      think he was ever disordered with liquor in his life. A man that
      I never knew to be otherwise than peaceable, and a man that I
      take to be rather timorous.&mdash;<i>Q</i>. Was he addicted
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg096" id="pg096">096</a></span>
      to pick up women in the streets?&mdash;<i>Dr. J. I</i> never knew
      that he was.&mdash;<i>Q</i>. How is he as to
      eyesight?&mdash;<i>Dr. J.</i> He does not see me now, nor do I
      see him. I do not believe he could be capable of assaulting any
      body in the street, without great provocation."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that Johnson's sensibility, such as it was, was not
      very severely taxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Boswell</i>.&mdash;But suppose now, Sir, that one of your
      intimate friends were apprehended for an offence for which he
      might be hanged?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Johnson</i>.&mdash;-I should do what I could to bail him; but
      if he were once fairly hanged, I should not suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Boswell</i>.&mdash;Would you eat your dinner that day, Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Johnson</i>.&mdash;Yes, Sir, and eat it as if he were eating
      it with me. Why, there's Baretti, who is to be tried for his life
      to-morrow. Friends have risen up for him on every side, yet if he
      should be hanged, none of them will eat a slice of plum-pudding
      the less. Sir, that sympathetic feeling goes a very little way in
      depressing the mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Steevens relates that one evening previous to the trial a
      consultation of Baretti's friends was held at the house of Mr.
      Cox, the solicitor. Johnson and Burke were present, and differed
      as to some point of the defence. On Steevens observing to Johnson
      that the question had been agitated with rather too much warmth,
      "It may be so," replied the sage, "for Burke and I should have
      been of one opinion if we had had no audience." This is coming
      very near to&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">

        "Would rather that the man should die

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg097" id="pg097">097</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Two anecdotes of Baretti during his imprisonment are preserved in
      "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Johnson and Burke went to see Baretti in Newgate, they had
      small comfort to give him, and bid him not hope too strongly.
      'Why what can <i>he</i> fear,' says Baretti, placing himself
      between 'em, 'that holds two such hands as I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An Italian came one day to Baretti, when he was in Newgate for
      murder, to desire a letter of recommendation for the teaching of
      his scholars, when he (Baretti) should be hanged. 'You rascal,'
      replies Baretti, in a rage, 'if I were not <i>in my own
      apartment</i>, I would kick you down stairs directly,'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The year after his acquittal Baretti published "Travels through
      Spain, Portugal, and France;" thus mentioned by Johnson in a
      Letter to Mrs, Thrale, dated Lichfield, July 20, 1770:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Baretti's book would please you all, I made no doubt. I
      know not whether the world has ever seen such travels before.
      Those whose lot it is to ramble can seldom write, and those who
      know how to write can seldom ramble." The rate of pay showed that
      the world was aware of the value of the acquisition. He gained
      <i>500l.</i> by this book. His "Frusta Letteraria," published
      some time before in Italy, had also attracted much attention,
      and, according to Johnson, he was the first who ever received
      money for copyright in Italy,
    </p>
    <p>
      In a biographical notice of Baretti which appeared in the
      "Gentleman's Magazine" for May, 1789, written by Dr. Vincent,
      Dean of Westminster, it is stated that it was <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg098" id="pg098">098</a></span> not distress
      which compelled him to accept Mr. Thrale's hospitality, but that
      he was overpersuaded by Johnson, contrary to his own inclination,
      to undertake the instruction of the Misses Thrale in Italian. "He
      was either nine or eleven years almost entirely in that family,"
      says the Dean, "though he still rented a lodging in town, during
      which period he expended his own <i>500l.</i>, and received
      nothing in return for his instruction, but the participation of a
      good table, and <i>150l.</i> by way of presents. Instead of his
      letters to Mrs. Piozzi in the 'European Magazine,' had he told
      this plain unvarnished tale, he would have convicted that lady of
      avarice and ingratitude, without incurring the danger of a reply,
      or exposing his memory to be insulted by her advocates."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was less than three years in the family. As he had a pension
      of <i>80l.</i> a year, besides the interest of his <i>500l.</i>,
      he did not want money. If he had been allowed to want it, the
      charge of avarice would lie at Mr., not Mrs., Thrale's door; and
      his memory was exposed to no insult beyond the stigma which (as
      we shall presently see) his conduct and language necessarily
      fixed upon it. All his literary friends did not entertain the
      same high opinion of him. An unpublished letter from Dr. Warton
      to his brother contains the following passage:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He (Huggins, the translator of Ariosto) abuses Baretti
      infernally, and says that he one day lent Baretti a gold watch,
      and could never get it afterwards; that after many excuses
      Baretti, skulked, and then got Johnson to write to Mr. Huggins a
      suppliant letter; <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg099" id=
      "pg099">099</a></span> that this letter stopped Huggins awhile,
      while Baretti got a protection from the Sardinian ambassador; and
      that, at last, with great difficulty, the watch was got from a
      pawnbroker to whom Baretti had sold it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This extract is copied from a valuable contribution to the
      literary annals of the eighteenth century, for which we are
      indebted to the colonial press.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> It
      is the diary of an Irish clergyman, containing strong internal
      evidence of authenticity, although nothing more is known of it
      than that the manuscript was discovered behind an old press in
      one of the offices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. That
      such a person saw a good deal of Johnson in 1775, is proved by
      Boswell, whose accuracy is frequently confirmed in return. In one
      marginal note Mrs. Thrale says: "He was a fine showy talking man.
      Johnson liked him of all things in a year or two." In another:
      "Dr. Campbell was a very tall handsome man, and, speaking of some
      other <i>High</i>-bernian, used this expression: 'Indeed now, and
      upon my honour, Sir, I am but a Twitter to him.'"<span class=

      Several of his entries throw light on the Thrale establishment:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>14th.</i>&mdash;This day I called at Mr. Thrale's, where I
      was received with all respect by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. She
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg100" id="pg100">100</a></span>
      is a very learned lady, and joins to the charms of her own sex,
      the manly understanding of ours. The immensity of the brewery
      astonished me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>16th.</i>&mdash;Dined with Mr. Thrale along with Dr. Johnson,
      and Baretti. Baretti is a plain sensible man, who seems to know
      the world well. He talked to me of the invitation given him by
      the College of Dublin, but said it (100<i>l.</i> a year and
      rooms) was not worth his acceptance; and if it had been, he said,
      in point of profit, still he would not have accepted it, for that
      now he could not live out of London. He had returned a few years
      ago to his own country, but he could not enjoy it; and he was
      obliged to return to London, to those connexions he had been
      making for near thirty years past. He told me he had several
      families with whom, both in town and country, he could go at any
      time and spend a month: he is at this time on these terms at Mr.
      Thrale's, and he knows how to keep his ground. Talking as we were
      at tea of the magnitude of the beer vessels, he said there was
      one thing in Mr. Thrale's house still more
      extraordinary;&mdash;meaning his wife. She gulped the pill very
      prettily,&mdash;so much for Baretti!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johnson, you are the very man Lord Chesterfield describes: a
      Hottentot indeed, and though your abilities are respectable, you
      never can be respected yourself! He has the aspect of an idiot,
      without the faintest ray of sense gleaming from any one
      feature&mdash;with the most awkward garb, and unpowdered grey
      wig, on one side only of his head&mdash;he is for ever dancing
      the devil's <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg101" id=
      "pg101">101</a></span> jig, and sometimes he makes the most
      driveling effort to whistle some thought in his absent
      paroxysms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>25th.</i>&mdash;Dined at Mr. Thrale's where there were ten or
      more gentlemen, and but one lady besides Mrs. Thrale. The dinner
      was excellent: first course, soups at head and foot, removed by
      fish and a saddle of mutton; second course, a fowl they call
      galena at head, and a capon larger than some of our Irish
      turkeys, at foot; third course, four different sorts of ices,
      pine-apple, grape, raspberry, and a fourth; in each remove there
      were I think fourteen dishes. The two first courses were served
      in massy plate. I sat beside Baretti, which was to me the richest
      part of the entertainment. He and Mr. and Mrs. Thrale joined in
      expressing to me Dr. Johnson's concern that he could not give me
      the meeting that day, but desired that I should go and see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>April 1st.</i>&mdash;Dined at Mr. Thrale's, whom in proof of
      the magnitude of London, I cannot help remarking, no coachman,
      and this is the third I have called, could find without inquiry.
      But of this by the way. There was Murphy, Boswell, and Baretti:
      the two last, as I learned just before I entered, are mortal
      foes, so much so that Murphy and Mrs. Thrale agreed that Boswell
      expressed a desire that Baretti should be hanged upon that
      unfortunate affair of his killing, &amp;c. Upon this hint, I
      went, and without any sagacity, it was easily discernible, for
      upon Baretti's entering Boswell did not rise, and upon Baretti's
      descry of Boswell he grinned a perturbed glance. Politeness
      however smooths the most hostile brows, and theirs <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg102" id="pg102">102</a></span> were
      smoothed. Johnson was the subject, both before and after dinner,
      for it was the boast of all but myself, that under that roof were
      the Doctor's fast friends. His <i>bon-mots</i> were retailed in
      such plenty, that they, like a surfeit, could not lie upon my
      memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "N.B. The 'Tour to the Western Isles' was written an twenty days,
      and the 'Patriot' in three; 'Taxation no Tyranny,' within a week:
      and not one of them would have yet seen the light, had it not
      been for Mrs. Thrale and Baretti, who stirred him up by laying
      wagers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>April 8th.</i>&mdash;Dined with Thrale, where Dr. Johnson
      was, and Boswell (and Baretti as usual). The Doctor was not in as
      good spirits as he was at Dilly's. He had supped the night before
      with Lady &mdash;&mdash;, Miss Jeffries, one of the maids of
      honour, Sir Joshua Reynolds, &amp;c., at Mrs. Abington's. He said
      Sir C. Thompson, and some others who were there, spoke like
      people who had seen good company, and so did Mrs. Abington
      herself, who could not have seen good company."
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell's note, alluding to the same topic, is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Saturday, April 8, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, where we
      met the Irish Dr. Campbell. Johnson had supped the night before
      at Mrs. Abington's with some fashionable people whom he named;
      and he seemed much pleased with having made one in so elegant a
      circle. Nor did he omit to pique his <i>mistress</i> a little
      with jealousy of her housewifery; for he said, with a smile,
      'Mrs. Abington's jelly, my dear lady, was better than yours.'"
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg103" id="pg103">103</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year is chiefly memorable for the separation from
      Baretti, thus mentioned in "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baretti had a comical aversion to Mrs. Macaulay, and his
      aversions are numerous and strong. If I had not once written his
      character in verse,<span class="fnref">[1]</span> I would now
      write it in prose, for few people know him better: he
      was&mdash;<i>Dieu me pardonne</i>, as the French say&mdash;my
      inmate for very near three years; and though I really liked the
      man once for his talents, and at last was weary of him for the
      use he made of them, I never altered my sentiments concerning
      him; for his character is easily seen, and his soul above
      disguise, haughty and insolent, and breathing defiance against
      all mankind; while his powers of mind exceed most people's, and
      his powers of purse are so slight that they leave him dependent
      on all. Baretti is for ever in the state of a stream dammed up:
      if he could once get loose, he would bear down all before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every soul that visited at our house while he was master of it,
      went away abhorring it; and Mrs. Montagu, grieved to see my
      meekness so imposed upon, had thoughts of writing me on the
      subject an anonymous letter, advising me to break with him.
      Seward, who tried at last to reconcile us, confessed his wonder
      that we had lived together so long. Johnson used to oppose and
      battle him, but never with his own consent: the moment he was
      cool, he would always condemn himself for exerting his
      superiority over a man who was his friend, a foreigner, and poor:
      yet I have been told <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg104" id=
      "pg104">104</a></span> by Mrs. Montagu that he attributed his
      loss of our family to Johnson: ungrateful and ridiculous! if it
      had not been for his mediation, I would not so long have borne
      trampling on, as I did for the last two years of our
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a servant, not a child, did he leave me any authority over;
      if I would attempt to correct or dismiss them, there was instant
      appeal to Mr. Baretti, who was sure always to be against me in
      every dispute. With Mr. Thrale I was ever cautious of contending,
      conscious that a misunderstanding there could never answer, as I
      have no friend or relation in the world to protect me from the
      rough treatment of a husband, should he chuse to exert his
      prerogatives; but when I saw Baretti openly urging Mr. Thrale to
      cut down some little fruit trees my mother had planted and I had
      begged might stand, I confess I did take an aversion to the
      creature, and secretly resolved his stay should not be prolonged
      by my intreaties whenever his greatness chose to take huff and be
      gone. As to my eldest daughter, his behaviour was most
      ungenerous; he was perpetually spurring her to independence,
      telling her she had more sense and would have a better fortune
      than her mother, whose admonitions she ought therefore to
      despise; that she ought to write and receive her own letters
      <i>now</i>, and not submit to an authority I could not keep up if
      she once had the spirit to challenge it; that, if I died in a
      lying-in which happened while he lived here, he hoped Mr. Thrale
      would marry Miss Whitbred, who would be a pretty companion for
      Hester, and not tyrannical <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg105"
      id="pg105">105</a></span> and overbearing like me. Was I not
      fortunate to see myself once quit of a man like this? who thought
      his dignity was concerned to set me at defiance, and who was
      incessantly telling lies to my prejudice in the ears of my
      husband and children? When he walked out of the house on the 6th
      day of July, 1776, I wrote down what follows in my table book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>6 July, 1776.</i>&mdash;This day is made remarkable by the
      departure of Mr. Baretti, who has, since October, 1773, been our
      almost constant inmate, companion, and, I vainly hoped, our
      friend. On the 11th of November, 1773, Mr. Thrale let him have
      <i>50l.</i> and at our return from France <i>50l.</i> more,
      besides his clothes and pocket money: in return to all this, he
      instructed our eldest daughter&mdash;or thought he did&mdash;and
      puffed her about the town for a wit, a genius, a linguist,
      &amp;c. At the beginning of the year 1776, we purposed visiting
      Italy under his conduct, but were prevented by an unforeseen and
      heavy calamity: that Baretti, however, might not be disappointed
      of money as well as of pleasure, Mr. Thrale presented him with
      100 guineas, which at first calmed his wrath a little, but did
      not, perhaps, make amends for his vexation; this I am the more
      willing to believe, as Dr. Johnson not being angry too, seemed to
      grieve him no little, after all our preparations made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now Johnson's virtue was engaged; and he, I doubt not, made it a
      point of conscience not to increase the distresses of a family
      already oppressed with affliction. Baretti, however, from this
      time grew sullen and captious; he went on as usual
      notwithstanding, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg106" id=
      "pg106">106</a></span> making Streatham his home, carrying on
      business there, when he thought he had any to do, and teaching
      his pupil at by-times when he chose so to employ himself; for he
      always took his choice of hours, and would often spitefully fix
      on such as were particularly disagreeable to me, whom he has now
      not liked a long while, if ever he did. He professed, however, a
      violent attachment to our eldest daughter; said if <i>she</i> had
      died instead of her poor brother, he should have destroyed
      himself, with many as wild expressions of fondness. Within these
      few days, when my back was turned, he would often be telling her
      that he would go away and stay a month, with other threats of the
      same nature; and she, not being of a caressing or obliging
      disposition, never, I suppose, soothed his anger or requested his
      stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of all this, however, I can know nothing but from <i>her</i>,
      who is very reserved, and whose kindness I cannot so confide in
      as to be sure she would tell me all that passed between them; and
      her attachment is probably greater to him than me, whom he has
      always endeavoured to lessen as much as possible, both in her
      eyes and&mdash;what was worse&mdash;her father's, by telling him
      how my parts had been over-praised by Johnson, and over-rated by
      the world; that my daughter's skill in languages, even at the age
      of fourteen, would vastly exceed mine, and such other idle stuff;
      which Mr. Thrale had very little care about, but which Hetty
      doubtless thought of great importance. Be this as it may, no
      angry words ever passed between him and me, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg107" id="pg107">107</a></span> except
      perhaps now and then a little spar or so when company was by, in
      the way of raillery merely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday, when Sir Joshua and Fitzmaurice dined here, I
      addressed myself to him with great particularity of attention,
      begging his company for Saturday, as I expected ladies, and said
      he must come and flirt with them, &amp;c. My daughter in the
      meantime kept on telling me that Mr. Baretti was grown very old
      and very cross, would not look at her exercises, but said he
      would leave this house soon, for it was no better than
      Pandæmonium. Accordingly, the next day he packed up his
      cloke-bag, which he had not done for three years, and sent it to
      town; and while we were wondering what he would say about it at
      breakfast, he was walking to London himself, without taking leave
      of any one person, except it may be the girl, who owns they had
      much talk, in the course of which he expressed great aversion to
      me and even to her, who, he said, he once thought well of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now whether she had ever told the man things that I might have
      said of him in his absence, by way of provoking him to go, and so
      rid herself of his tuition; whether he was puffed up with the
      last 100 guineas and longed to be spending it <i>all'
      Italiano;</i> whether he thought Mr. Thrale would call him back,
      and he should be better established here than ever; or whether he
      really was idiot enough to be angry at my threatening to whip
      Susan and Sophy for going out of bounds, although <i>he</i> had
      given them leave, for Hetty said that was the first offence he
      took huff at, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg108" id=
      "pg108">108</a></span> I never now shall know, for he never
      expressed himself as an offended man to me, except one day when
      he was not shaved at the proper hour forsooth, and then I would
      not quarrel with him, because nobody was by, and I knew him be so
      vile a lyar that I durst not trust his tongue with a dispute. He
      is gone, however, loaded with little presents from me, and with a
      large share too of my good opinion, though I most sincerely
      rejoice in his departure, and hope we shall never meet more but
      by chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since our quarrel I had occasion to talk of him with Tom Davies,
      who spoke with horror of his ferocious temper; 'and yet,' says I,
      'there is great sensibility about Baretti: I have seen tears
      often stand in his eyes.' 'Indeed,' replies Davies, 'I should
      like to have seen that sight vastly, when&mdash;even butchers
      weep.'"

      set down at breakfast my dish of tea not half drank, go for my
      hat and stick that lay in the corner of the room, turn my back to
      the house <i>insalutato hospite</i>, and walk away to London
      without uttering a syllable, fully resolved never to see her
      again, as was the case during no less than four years; nor had
      she and I ever met again as friends if she and her husband had
      not chanced upon me after that lapse of time at the house of a
      gentleman near Beckenham, and coaxed me into a reconciliation,
      which, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg109" id=
      "pg109">109</a></span> as almost all reconciliations prove, was
      not very sincere on her side or mine; so that there was a total
      end of it on Mr. Thrale's demise, which happened about three
      years after."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      The monotony of a constant residence at Streatham was varied by
      trips to Bath or Brighton; and it was so much a matter of course
      for Johnson to make one of the party, that when (1776), not
      expecting him so soon back from a journey with Boswell, the
      Thrale family and Baretti started for Bath without him, Boswell
      is disposed to treat their departure without the lexicographer as
      a slight:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was not showing the attention which might have been
      expected to the 'guide, philosopher, and friend;' the
      <i>Imlac</i> who had hastened from the country to console a
      distressed mother, who he understood was very anxious for his
      return. They had, I found, without ceremony, proceeded on their
      journey. I was glad to understand from him that it was still
      resolved that his tour to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale should
      take place, of which he had entertained some doubt, on account of
      the loss which they had suffered; and his doubts afterwards
      appeared to be well founded. He observed, indeed, very justly,
      that 'their loss was an additional reason for their going abroad;
      and if it had not been fixed that he should have been one of the
      party, he would force them out; but he would not advise them
      unless his advice was asked, lest they might suspect that he
      recommended what he wished on his own <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg110" id="pg110">110</a></span> account.' I
      was not pleased that his intimacy with Mr. Thrale's family,
      though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment,
      was not without some degree of restraint<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>: not, as has been grossly
      suggested<span class="fnref">[2]</span>, that it was required of
      him as a task to talk for the entertainment of them and their
      company; but that he was not quite at his ease: which, however,
      might partly be owing to his own honest pride&mdash;that dignity
      of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] (<i>Marginal note</i>). "What restraint can he mean?
        Johnson kept every one else under restraint."

      In his first letter of condolence on Mr. Thrale's death, Johnson
      speaks of her having enjoyed happiness in marriage, "to a degree
      of which, without personal knowledge, I should have thought the
      description fabulous." The "Autobiography" and "Thraliana" tell a
      widely different tale. The mortification of not finding herself
      appreciated by her husband was poignantly increased, during the
      last years of his life, by finding another offensively preferred
      to her. He was so fascinated by one of her fair friends, as to
      lose sight altogether of what was due to appearances or to the
      feelings of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full account of the lady in question is given in the
      "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Miss Streatfield</i>.&mdash;I have since heard that Dr.
      Collier picked up a more useful friend, a Mrs. Streatfield, a
      widow, high in fortune and rather eminent both for the beauties
      of person and mind; her children, I find, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg111" id="pg111">111</a></span> he has been
      educating; and her eldest daughter is just now coming out into
      the world with a great character for elegance and
      literature.&mdash;<i>20 November, 1776.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>19 May, 1778.</i>&mdash;The person who wrote the title of
      this book at the top of the page, on the other side&mdash;left
      hand&mdash;in the black letter, was the identical Miss Sophia
      Streatfield, mentioned in 'Thraliana,' as pupil to poor dear
      Doctor Collier, after he and I had parted. By the chance meeting
      of some of the currents which keep this ocean of human life from
      stagnating, this lady and myself were driven together nine months
      ago at Brighthelmstone: we soon grew intimate from having often
      heard of each other, and I have now the honour and happiness of
      calling her my friend. Her face is eminently pretty; her carriage
      elegant; her heart affectionate, and her mind cultivated. There
      is above all this an attractive sweetness in her manner, which
      claims and promises to repay one's confidence, and which drew
      from me the secret of my keeping a 'Thraliana,' &amp;c. &amp;c.
      &amp;c."

      "<i>Jan. 1779.</i>&mdash;Mr. Thrale is fallen in love, really and
      seriously, with Sophy Streatfield; but there is no wonder in
      that; she is very pretty, very gentle, soft, and insinuating;
      hangs about him, dances round him, cries when she parts from him,
      squeezes his hand slyly, and with her sweet eyes full of tears
      looks so fondly in his face<span class=

      town: she is in the 'Morning Post' too, I see (to be in the
      'Morning Post' is no good thing). She has won Wedderburne's heart
      from his wife, I believe, and few married women will bear
      <i>that</i> patiently if I do; they will some of them wound her
      reputation, so that I question whether it can recover. Lady
      Erskine made many odd inquiries about her to me yesterday, and
      winked and looked wise at her sister. The dear S.S. must be a
      little on her guard; nothing is so spiteful as a woman robbed of
      a heart she thinks she has a claim upon. She will not lose
      <i>that</i> with temper, which she has taken perhaps no pains at
      all to preserve: and I do not observe with any pleasure, I fear,
      that my husband prefers Miss Streatfield to me, though I must
      acknowledge her younger, handsomer, and a better scholar.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg113" id="pg113">113</a></span>
      Of her chastity, however, I never had a doubt: she was bred by
      Dr. Collier in the strictest principles of piety and virtue; she
      not only knows she will be always chaste, but she knows why she
      will be so.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Mr. Thrale is now by
      dint of disease quite out of the question, so I am a
      disinterested spectator; but her coquetry is very dangerous
      indeed, and I wish she were married that there might be an end
      on't. Mr. Thrale loves her, however, sick or well, better by a
      thousand degrees than he does me or any one else, and even now
      desires nothing on earth half so much as the sight of his Sophia.

      (as she told me herself), and said 'Sophy, we shall not enjoy
      this long, and to-night I will not be cheated of my only
      comfort.' Poor soul! how shockingly tender! On the first Fryday
      that he spoke after his stupor, she came to see him, and as she
      sate by the bedside pitying him, 'Oh,' says he, 'who would not

      somehow, at the same time declaring her attachment to Vyse yet
      her willingness to marry Lord Loughborough. Good God! what an
      uncommon girl! and handsome almost to perfection, I think:
      delicate in her manners, soft in her voice, and strict in her
      principles: I never saw such a character, she is wholly out of my

      neither pains nor caresses to turn that good man's head, much to
      the vexation of his family; particularly my Fanny, who is
      naturally provoked to see sport made of her father in his last
      stage of life by a young coquet, whose sole employment in this
      world seems to have been winning men's hearts on purpose to fling
      them away. How she contrives to keep bishops, and brewers, and
      doctors, and directors of the East India Company, all in chains
      so, and almost all at the same time, would amaze a wiser person
      than me; I can only say let us mark the end! Hester will perhaps
      see her out and pronounce, like Solon, on her wisdom and
      conduct."

      As this lady has excited great interest, and was much with the

      said 'she is a sweet creature, and I love her much; but my little
      Burney writes a better letter.' Now,' continued she, 'that is
      just what I wished him to say of you both.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, Sept</i>. 1779.&mdash;Mr. Seward, you know, told
      me that she had tears at command, and I begin to think so too,
      for when Mrs. Thrale, who had previously told me I should see her
      cry, began coaxing her to stay, and saying, 'If you go, I shall
      know you don't love me so well as Lady Gresham,'&mdash;she did
      cry, not loud indeed, nor much, but the tears came into her eyes,
      and rolled down her fine cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Come hither, Miss Burney,' cried Mrs. Thrale; 'come and see
      Miss Streatfield cry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it a mere <i>badinage</i>. I went to them, but when I
      saw real tears, I was shocked, and saying, 'No, I won't look at
      her,' ran away frightened, lest she should think I laughed at
      her, which Mrs. Thrale did so openly, that, as I told her, had
      she served me so, I should have been affronted with her ever
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Streatfield, however, whether from a sweetness not to be
      ruffled, or from not perceiving there was any room for taking
      offence, gently wiped her eyes, and was perfectly composed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, June</i>, 1779.&mdash;Seward, said Mrs. Thrale,
      had affronted Johnson, and then Johnson affronted Seward, and
      then the S.S. cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sir Philip</i> (<i>Clerke</i>).&mdash;Well, I have heard so
      much of these tears, that I would give the universe to have a
      sight of them. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg117" id=
      "pg117">117</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mrs. Thrale</i>.&mdash;Well, she shall cry again, if you like
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>S.S.</i>.&mdash;No, pray, Mrs. Thrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sir Philip</i>.&mdash;Oh, pray do! pray let me see a little
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mrs. Thrale</i>.&mdash;Yes, do cry a little Sophy [in a
      wheedling voice], pray do! Consider, now, you are going to-day,
      and it's very hard if you won't cry a little: indeed, S.S., you
      ought to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for the wonder of wonders. When Mrs. Thrale, in a coaxing
      voice, suited to a nurse soothing a baby, had run on for some
      time,&mdash;while all the rest of us, in laughter, joined in the
      request,&mdash;two crystal tears came into the soft eyes of the
      S.S., and rolled gently down her cheeks! Such a sight I never saw
      before, nor could I have believed. She offered not to conceal or
      dissipate them: on the contrary, she really contrived to have
      them seen by everybody. She looked, indeed, uncommonly handsome;
      for her pretty face was not, like Chloe's, blubbered; it was
      smooth and elegant, and neither her features nor complexion were
      at all ruffled; nay, indeed, she was smiling all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Look, look!' cried Mrs. Thrale; 'see if the tears are not come
      already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loud and rude bursts of laughter broke from us all at once. How,
      indeed, could they be restrained?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, Sunday, June</i> 13, 1779.&mdash;After church we
      all strolled round the grounds, and the topic of our discourse
      was Miss Streatfield. Mrs. Thrale asserted that she had a power
      of captivation that was irresistible; <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg118" id="pg118">118</a></span> that her
      beauty, joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her
      tearful eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the
      heart of any man she thought worth attacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Philip declared himself of a totally different opinion, and
      quoted Dr. Johnson against her, who had told him that, taking
      away her Greek, she was as ignorant as a butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Seward declared her Greek was all against her with him, for
      that, instead of reading Pope, Swift, or the
      Spectator&mdash;books from which she might derive useful
      knowledge and improvement&mdash;it had led her to devote all her
      reading time to the first eight books of Homer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But,' said Mrs. Thrale, 'her Greek, you must own, has made all
      her celebrity;&mdash;you would have heard no more of her than of
      any other pretty girl, but for that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What I object to,' said Sir Philip, 'is her avowed preference
      for this parson. Surely it is very indelicate in any lady to let
      all the world know with whom she is in love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The parson,' said the severe Mr. Seward, 'I suppose, spoke
      first,&mdash;or she would as soon have been in love with you, or
      with me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will easily believe I gave him no pleasant look."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson was the Rev. Dr. Vyse, Rector of Lambeth. He had made
      an imprudent marriage early in life, and was separated from his
      wife, of whom he hoped <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg119" id=
      "pg119">119</a></span> to get rid either by divorce or by her
      death, as she was reported to be in bad health. Under these
      circumstances, he had entered into a conditional engagement with
      the fair S.S.; but eventually threw her over, either in despair
      at his wife's longevity or from caprice. On the mention of his
      name by Boswell, Mrs. Piozzi writes opposite: "whose connection
      with Sophia Streatfield was afterwards so much talked about, and
      I suppose never understood: certainly not at all by H.L.P." To
      return to the D'Arblay Diary:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, June</i> 14, 1781.&mdash;We had my dear father and
      Sophy Streatfield, who, as usual, was beautiful, caressing,
      amiable, sweet, and&mdash;fatiguing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, Aug</i>. 1781.&mdash;Some time after Sophy
      Streatfield was talked of,&mdash;Oh, with how much impertinence!
      as if she was at the service of any man who would make proposals
      to her! Yet Mr. Seward spoke of her with praise and tenderness
      all the time, as if, though firmly of this opinion, he was warmly
      her admirer. From such admirers and such admiration Heaven guard
      me! Mr. Crutchley said but little; but that little was bitter
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'However,' said Mr. Seward, 'after all that can be said, there
      is nobody whose manners are more engaging, nobody more amiable
      than the little Sophy; and she is certainly very pretty; I must
      own I have always been afraid to trust myself with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here Mr. Crutchley looked very sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nay, 'squire,' cried Mr. Seward, 'she is very dangerous, I can
      tell you; and if she had you at a fair trial, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg120" id="pg120">120</a></span> she would
      make an impression that would soften-even your hard heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No need of any further trial,' said he, laughing, 'for she has
      done that already; and so soft was the impression that it
      absolutely all dissolved!&mdash;melted quite away, and not a
      trace of it left!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Seward then proposed that she should marry Sir John Miller,
      who has just lost his wife; and very gravely said, he had a great
      mind to set out for Tunbridge, and carry her with him to Bath,
      and so make the match without delay!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But surely,' said Mrs. Thrale, 'if you fail, you will think
      yourself bound in honour to marry her yourself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, that's the thing,' said he; 'no, I can't take the little
      Sophy myself; I should have too many rivals; rivals; no, that
      won't do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "How abominably conceited and <i>sure</i> these pretty gentlemen
      are! However, Mr. Crutchley here made a speech that half won my
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I wish,' said he, 'Miss Streatfield was here at this moment to
      cuff you, Seward!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cuff me,' cried he. 'What, the little Sophy!&mdash;and why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'For disposing of her so freely. I think a man deserves to be
      cuffed for saying <i>any</i> lady will marry him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seconded this speech with much approbation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>London, Jan.</i> 1783.&mdash;Before they went came Miss
      Streatfield, looking pale, but very elegant and pretty.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg121" id="pg121">121</a></span>
      She was in high spirits, and I hope has some reason. She made, at
      least, speeches that provoked such surmises. When the Jacksons
      went,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That,' said I, 'is the celebrated Jackson of Exeter; I dare say
      you would like him if you knew him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I dare say I should,' cried she, simpering; 'for he has the two
      requisites for me,&mdash;he is tall and thin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, this did not at all call for raillery! Dr. Vyse has
      always been distinguished by these two epithets. I said, however,
      nothing, as my mother was present; but she would not let my looks
      pass unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh!' cried she, 'how wicked you look!&mdash;No need of seeing
      Mrs. Siddons for expression!&mdash;However, you know how much
      that is my taste,&mdash;tall and thin!&mdash;but you don't know
      how <i>apropos</i> it is just now!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine years after the last entry, we find:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>May</i> 25, 1792.&mdash;We now met Mrs. Porteous; and who
      should be with her but the poor pretty S.S., whom so long I had
      not seen, and who has now lately been finally given up by her
      long-sought and very injurious lover, Dr. Vyse?
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is sadly faded, and looked disturbed and unhappy but still
      beautiful, though no longer blooming; and still affectionate,
      though absent and evidently absorbed. We had a little chat
      together about the Thrales. In mentioning our former intimacy
      with them, 'Ah, those,' she cried, 'were happy times!' and her
      eyes glistened. Poor thing! hers has been a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg122" id="pg122">122</a></span> lamentable
      story!&mdash;Imprudence and vanity have rarely been mixed with so
      much sweetness, and good-humour, and candour, and followed with
      more reproach and ill success. We agreed to renew acquaintance
      next winter; at present she will be little more in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter to Madame D'Arblay, Oct. 20, 1820, Mrs. Piozzi says:
      "Fell, the bookseller in Bond Street, told me a fortnight or
      three weeks ago, that Miss Streatfield lives where she did in his
      neighbourhood, Clifford Street, S.S. still." On the 18th January,
      1821: "'The once charming S.S. had inquired for me of Nornaville
      and Fell, the Old Bond Street book-sellers, so I thought she
      meditated writing, but was deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      The story she told the author of "Piozziana," in proof of
      Johnson's want of firmness, clearly refers to this lady:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had remarked to her that Johnson's readiness to condemn any
      moral deviation in others was, in a man so entirely before the
      public as he was, nearly a proof of his own spotless purity of
      conduct. She said, 'Yes, Johnson was, on the whole, a rigid
      moralist; but he could be ductile, I may say, servile; and I will
      give you an instance. We had a large dinner-party at our house;
      Johnson sat on one side of me, and Burke on the other; and in the
      company there was a young female (Mrs. Piozzi named her), to whom
      I, in my peevishness, thought Mr. Thrale superfluously attentive,
      to the neglect of me and others; especially of myself, then near
      my confinement, and dismally low-spirited; <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg123" id="pg123">123</a></span>
      notwithstanding which, Mr. T. very unceremoniously begged of me
      to change place with Sophy &mdash;&mdash;, who was threatened
      with a sore throat, and might be injured by sitting near the
      door. I had scarcely swallowed a spoonful of soup when this
      occurred, and was so overset by the coarseness of the proposal,
      that I burst into tears, said something petulant&mdash;that
      perhaps ere long, the lady might be at the head of Mr. T.'s
      table, without displacing the mistress of the house, &amp;c., and
      so left the apartment. I retired to the drawing-room, and for an
      hour or two contended with my vexation, as I best could, when
      Johnson and Burke came up. On seeing them, I resolved to give a
      <i>jobation</i> to both, but fixed on Johnson for my charge, and
      asked him if he had noticed what passed, what I had suffered, and
      whether allowing for the state of my nerves, I was much to blame?
      He answered, "Why, possibly not; your feelings were outraged." I
      said, "Yes, greatly so; and I cannot help remarking with what
      blandness and composure you <i>witnessed</i> the outrage. Had
      this transaction been told of others, your anger would have known
      no bounds; but, towards a man who gives good dinners &amp;c., you
      were meekness itself!" Johnson coloured, and Burke, I thought,
      looked foolish; but I had not a word of answer from either.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The only excuse for Mr. Thrale is to be found in his mental and
      bodily condition at the time, which made it impossible for
      Johnson or Burke to interfere without a downright quarrel with
      him, nor without making matters worse. This, however, is not the
      only instance <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg124" id=
      "pg124">124</a></span> in which Johnson witnessed Thrale's laxity
      of morals without reproving it. Opposite the passage in which
      Boswell reports Johnson as palliating infidelity in a husband by
      the remark, that the man imposes no bastards on his wife, she
      writes: "Sometimes he does. Johnson knew a man who did, and the
      lady took very tender care of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay was not uniformly such a source of comfort to her
      as that lady supposed. The entries in "Thraliana" relating to her
      show this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August,</i> 1779.&mdash;Fanny Burney has been a long time
      from me; I was glad to see her again; yet she makes me miserable
      too in many respects, so restlessly and apparently anxious, lest
      I should give myself airs of patronage or load her with the
      shackles of dependance. I live with her always in a degree of
      pain that precludes friendship&mdash;dare not ask her to buy me a
      ribbon&mdash;dare not desire her to touch the bell, lest she
      should think herself injured&mdash;lest she should forsooth
      appear in the character of Miss Neville, and I in that of the
      widow Bromley. See Murphy's 'Know Your Own Mind.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fanny Burney has kept her room here in my house seven days, with
      a fever or something that she called a fever; I gave her every
      medicine and every slop with my own hand; took away her dirty
      cups, spoons, &amp;c.; moved her tables: in short, was doctor,
      and nurse and maid&mdash;for I did not like the servants should
      have additional trouble lest they should hate her for it. And
      now,&mdash;with the true gratitude of a wit, she tells me
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg125" id="pg125">125</a></span>
      that the world thinks the better of me for my civilities to her.
      It does? does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Burney was much admired at Bath (1780); the puppy-men said,
      'She had such a drooping air and such a timid intelligence;' or,
      'a timid air,' I think it was,' and a drooping intelligence;'
      never sure was such a collection of pedantry and affectation as
      rilled Bath when we were on that spot. How everything else and
      everybody set off my gallant bishop. 'Quantum lenta solent inter
      viburna Cupressi.' Of all the people I ever heard read verse in
      my whole life, the best, the most perfect reader, is the Bishop
      of Peterboro' (Hinchcliffe.)"<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] In a marginal note on Boswell, she says: "The people (in
        1783) did read shamefully. Yet Mr. Lee, the poet, many years
        before Johnson was born, read so gracefully, the players would
        not accept his tragedies till they had heard them from other
        lips: his own (they said) sweetened all which proceeded from
        them." Speaker Onslow equally was celebrated for his manner of
        reading.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "<i>July 1st</i>, 1780.&mdash;Mrs. Byron, who really loves me,
      was disgusted at Miss Burney's carriage to me, who have been such
      a friend and benefactress to her: not an article of dress, not a
      ticket for public places, not a thing in the world that she could
      not command from me: yet always insolent, always pining for home,
      always preferring the mode of life in St. Martin's Street to all
      I could do for her. She is a saucy-spirited little puss to be
      sure, but I love her dearly for all that; and I fancy she has a
      real regard for me, if she did not think it beneath the dignity
      of a wit, or of what she values more&mdash;the dignity of Dr.
      Burnett's daughter&mdash;to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg126"

      Louisa of Leicester Square!<span class="fnref">[1]</span> In good

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "1781.&mdash;What a blockhead Dr. Burney is to be always sending
      for his daughter home so! what a monkey! is she not better and
      happier with me than she can be anywhere else? Johnson is enraged
      at the silliness of their family conduct, and Mrs. Byron
      disgusted; I confess myself provoked excessively, but I love the
      girl so dearly&mdash;and the Doctor, too, for that matter, only
      that he has such odd notions of superiority in his own house, and
      will have his children under his feet forsooth, rather than let
      'em live in peace, plenty, and comfort anywhere from home. If I
      did not provide Fanny with every wearable&mdash;every wishable,
      indeed,&mdash;it would not vex me to be served so; but to see the
      impossibility of compensating for the pleasures of St. Martin's
      Street, makes one at once merry and mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Burney did not like his daughter should learn Latin even of
      Johnson, who offered to teach her for friendship, because then
      she would have been as wise as himself forsooth, and Latin was
      too masculine for Misses. A narrow-souled goose-cap the man must
      be at last, agreeable and amiable all the while too, beyond
      almost any other human creature. Well, mortal man is but a paltry
      animal! the best of us have such drawbacks both upon virtue,
      wisdom, and knowledge." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg127" id=
      "pg127">127</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In what his daughter calls a doggrel list of his friends and his
      feats, Dr. Burney has thus mentioned the Thrales:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "1776.&mdash;This year's acquaintance began with the Thrales,
      </p>
      <p>
        Where I met with great talents 'mongst females and males,
      </p>
      <p>
        But the best thing it gave me from that time to this,
      </p>
      <p>
        Was the freedom it gave me to sound the abyss,
      </p>
      <p>
        At my ease and my leisure, of Johnson's great mind,

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Highly to her credit, Mrs. Thrale did not omit any part of her
      own duties to her husband because he forgot his. In March, 1780,
      she writes to Johnson:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am willing to show myself in Southwark, or in any place, for
      my master's pleasure or advantage; but have no present conviction
      that to be re-elected would be advantageous, so shattered a state
      as his nerves are in just now.&mdash;Do not you, however, fancy
      for a moment, that I shrink from fatigue&mdash;or desire to
      escape from doing my duty;&mdash;spiting one's antagonist is a
      reason that never ought to operate, and never does operate with
      me: I care nothing about a rival candidate's innuendos, I care
      only about my husband's health and fame; and if we find that he
      earnestly wishes to be once more member for the Borough&mdash;he
      <i>shall</i> be member, if anything done or suffered by me will
      help make him so."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the May following she writes: "Meanwhile, Heaven send this
      Southwark election safe, for a disappointment would half kill my
      husband, and there is <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg128" id=

      in such a manner and losing the town at last."

      This was an agitating month. In "Thraliana ":

      "<i>20th May</i>, 1780.&mdash;I got back to Bath again and staid
      there till the riots<span class="fnref">[1]</span> drove us all
      away the first week in June: we made a dawdling journey, cross
      country, to Brighthelmstone, where all was likely to be at peace:
      the letters we found there, however, shewed us how near we were
      to ruin here in the Borough: where nothing but the astonishing
      presence of mind shewed by Perkins in amusing the mob with meat
      and drink and huzzas, till Sir Philip Jennings Clerke could get
      the troops and pack up the counting-house bills, bonds, &amp;c.
      and carry them, which he did, to Chelsea College for
      safety,&mdash;could have saved us from actual undoing. The
      villains <i>had</i> broke in, and our brewhouse would have blazed
      in ten minutes, when a property of £150,000 would have been
      utterly lost, and its once flourishing possessors quite undone.

      In the spring of 1781, "I found," says Boswell, "on visiting Mr.
      Thrale that he was now very ill, and had removed, I suppose by
      the solicitation of Mrs. Thrale, to a house in Grosvenor Square."
      She has written opposite: "Spiteful again! He went by direction
      of his physicians where they could easiest attend to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal to Grosvenor Square is thus mentioned in "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Monday, January 29th</i>, 1781.&mdash;So now we are to spend
      this winter in Grosvenor Square; my master has taken a
      ready-furnished lodging-house there, and we go in to-morrow. He
      frighted me cruelly a while ago; he would have Lady Shelburne's
      house, one of the finest in London; he would buy, he would build,
      he would give twenty to thirty guineas a week for a house. Oh
      Lord, thought I, the people will sure enough throw stones at me
      now when they see a dying man go to such mad expenses, and all,
      as they will naturally think, to please a wife wild with the love
      of expense. This was the very thing I endeavoured to avoid by
      canvassing the borough for him, in hopes of being through that
      means tyed to the brewhouse where I always hated to live till
      now, that I conclude his constitution lost, and that the world
      will say <i>I</i> tempt him in his weak state of body and mind
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg130" id="pg130">130</a></span>
      to take a fine house for me at the flashy end of the town." "He
      however, dear creature, is as absolute, ay, and ten times more
      so, than ever, since he suspects his head to be suspected, and to
      Grosvenor Square we are going, and I cannot be sorry, for it will
      doubtless be comfortable enough to see one's friends

      On February 7, 1781, she writes to Madame D'Arblay:

    <p>
      "Yesterday I had a conversazione. Mrs. Montagu was brilliant in
      diamonds, solid in judgment, critical in talk. Sophy smiled,
      Piozzi sung, Pepys panted with admiration, Johnson was good
      humoured, Lord John Clinton attentive, Dr. Bowdler lame, and my
      master not asleep. Mrs. Ord looked elegant, Lady Rothes dainty,
      Mrs. Davenant dapper, and Sir Philip's curls were all blown about
      by the wind. Mrs. Byron rejoices that her Admiral and I agree so
      well; the way to his heart is connoisseurship it seems, and for a
      background and contorno, who comes up to Mrs. Thrale, you know."

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg131" id="pg131">131</a></span>
      experienced the delights of a London winter, spent in the bosom
      of flattery, gayety, and Grosvenor Square; 'tis a poor thing,
      however, and leaves a void in the mind, but I have had my
      compting-house duties to attend, my sick master to watch, my
      little children to look after, and how much good have I done in
      any way? Not a scrap as I can see; the pecuniary affairs have
      gone on perversely: how should they chuse [an omission here] when
      the sole proprietor is incapable of giving orders, yet not so far
      incapable as to be set aside! Distress, fraud, folly, meet me at
      every turn, and I am not able to fight against them all, though
      endued with an iron constitution, which shakes not by sleepless
      nights or days severely fretted.

    <p>
      "Mr. Thrale talks now of going to Spa and Italy again; how shall
      we drag him thither? A man who cannot keep awake four hours at a
      stroke &amp;c. Well! this will indeed be a tryal of one's
      patience; and who must go with us on this expedition? Mr.
      Johnson!&mdash;he will indeed be the only happy person of the
      party; he values nothing <i>under</i> heaven but his own mind,
      which is a spark <i>from</i> heaven, and that will be invigorated
      by the addition of new ideas. If Mr. Thrale dies on the road,
      Johnson will console himself by learning how it is to travel with
      a corpse: and, after all, such reasoning is the true
      philosophy&mdash;one's heart is a mere incumbrance&mdash;would I
      could leave mine behind. The children shall go to their sisters
      at Kensington, Mrs. Cumyns may take care of them all. God grant

      "Baretti should attend, I think; there is no man who has so much
      of every language, and can manage so well with Johnson, is so
      tidy on the road, so active top to obtain good accommodations. He
      is the man in the world, I think, whom I most abhor, and who
      <i>hates</i> and <i>professes</i> to <i>hate me</i> the most; but
      what does that signifie? He will be careful of Mr. Thrale and
      Hester whom he <i>does</i> love&mdash;and he won't strangle
      <i>me</i>, I suppose. Somebody we <i>must</i> have. Croza would
      court our daughter, and Piozzi could not talk to Johnson, nor, I
      suppose, do one any good but sing to one,&mdash;and how should we
      <i>sing songs in a strange land</i>? Baretti must be the man, and
      I will beg it of him as a favour. Oh, the triumph he will have!
      and the lyes he will tell!" Thrale's death is thus described in
      "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the Sunday, the 1st of April, I went to hear the Bishop of
      Peterborough preach at May Fair Chapel, and though the sermon had
      nothing in it particularly pathetic, I could not keep my tears
      within my eyes. I spent the evening, however, at Lady Rothes',
      and was cheerful. Found Sir John Lade, Johnson, and Boswell, with
      Mr. Thrale, at my return to the Square. On Monday morning Mr.
      Evans came to breakfast; Sir Philip and Dr. Johnson to
      dinner&mdash;so did Baretti. Mr. Thrale eat voraciously&mdash;so
      voraciously that, encouraged by Jebb and Pepys, who had charged
      me to do so, I checked him rather severely, and Mr. Johnson added
      these remarkable words: "Sir, after the denunciation of your
      physicians this morning, such eating is little better than
      suicide." He did not, however, desist, and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg133" id="pg133">133</a></span> Sir Philip
      said, he eat apparently in defiance of control, and that it was
      better for us to say nothing to him. Johnson observed that he
      thought so too; and that he spoke more from a sense of duty than
      a hope of success. Baretti and these two spent the evening with
      me, and I was enumerating the people who were to meet the Indian
      ambassadors on the Wednesday. I had been to Negri's and bespoke
      an elegant entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the next day, Tuesday the 3rd, Mrs. Hinchliffe called on me
      in the morning to go see Webber's drawings of the South Sea
      rareties. We met the Smelts, the Ords, and numberless
      <i>blues</i> there, and displayed our pedantry at our pleasure.
      Going and coming, however, I quite teazed Mrs. Hinchliffe with my
      low-spirited terrors about Mr. Thrale, who had not all this while
      one symptom worse than he had had for months; though the
      physicians this Tuesday morning agreed that a continuation of
      such dinners as he had lately made would soon dispatch a life so
      precarious and uncertain. When I came home to dress, Piozzi, who
      was in the next room teaching Hester to sing, began lamenting
      that he was engaged to Mrs. Locke on the following evening, when
      I had such a world of company to meet these fine Orientals; he
      had, however, engaged Roncaglia and Sacchini to begin with, and
      would make a point of coming himself at nine o'clock if possible.
      I gave him the money I had collected for his
      benefit&mdash;35<i>l</i>. I remember it was&mdash;a banker's
      note&mdash;and burst out o' crying, and said, I was sure I should
      not go to it. The man was shocked, and wondered what I meant.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg134" id="pg134">134</a></span>
      Nay, says I, 'tis mere lowness of spirits, for Mr. Thrale is very
      well now, and is gone out in his carriage to spit cards, as I
      call'd it&mdash;sputar le carte. Just then came a letter from Dr.
      Pepys, insisting to speak with me in the afternoon, and though
      there was nothing very particular in the letter considering our
      intimacy, I burst out o' crying again, and threw myself into an
      agony, saying, I was sure Mr. Thrale would dye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Owen came to dinner, and Mr. Thrale came home so well! and
      in such spirits! he had invited more people to my concert, or
      conversazione, or musical party, of the next day, and was
      delighted to think what a show we should make. He eat, however,
      more than enormously. Six things the day before, and eight on
      this day, with strong beer in such quantities! the very servants
      were frighted, and when Pepys came in the evening he said this
      could not last&mdash;either there must be
      <i>legal</i><span class="fnref">[1]</span> restraint or certain
      death. Dear Mrs. Byron spent the evening with me, and Mr.
      Crutchley came from Sunning-hill to be ready for the morrow's
      flash. Johnson was at the Bishop of Chester's. I went down in the
      course of the afternoon to see after my master as usual, and
      found him not asleep, but sitting with his legs
      up&mdash;<i>because</i>, as he express'd it. I kissed him, and
      said how good he was to be so careful of himself. He enquired who
      was above, but had no disposition to <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg135" id="pg135">135</a></span> come up
      stairs. Miss Owen and Mrs. Byron now took their leave. The Dr.
      had been gone about twenty minutes when Hester went down to see
      her papa, and found him on the floor. What's the meaning of this?
      says she, in an agony. I chuse it, replies Mr. Thrale firmly; I
      lie so o' purpose. She ran, however, to call his valet, who was
      gone out&mdash;happy to leave him so particularly <i>well</i>, as
      he thought. When my servant went instead, Mr. Thrale bid him
      begone, in a firm tone, and added that he was very well and chose
      to lie so. By this time, however, Mr. Crutchley was run down at
      Hetty's intreaty, and had sent to fetch Pepys back. He was got
      but into Upper Brook Street, and found his friend in a most
      violent fit of the apoplexy, from which he only recovered to
      relapse into another, every one growing weaker as his strength
      grew less, till six o'clock on Wednesday morning, 4th April,
      1781, when he died. Sir Richard Jebb, who was fetched at the
      beginning of the distress, seeing death certain, quitted the
      house without even prescribing. Pepys did all that could be done,
      and Johnson, who was sent for at eleven o'clock, never left him,
      for while breath remained he still hoped. I ventured in once, and
      saw them cutting his clothes off to bleed him, but I saw no
      more."

        [1] (<i>Note</i> by Mrs. T.). "I rejected all propositions of
        the sort, and said, as he had got the money, he had the best
        right to throw it away.... I should always prefer my husband,
        to my children: let him do his <i>own</i> way."

    <p>
      We learn from Madame D'Arblay's Journal, that, towards the end of
      March, 1781, Mr. Thrale had resolved on going abroad with his
      wife, and that Johnson was to accompany them, but a subsequent
      entry states that the doctors condemned the plan; and
      "therefore," she adds, "it is settled that a great meeting of his
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg136" id="pg136">136</a></span>
      friends is to take place before he actually prepares for the
      journey, and they are to encircle him in a body, and endeavour,
      by representations and entreaties, 'to prevail with him to give
      it up; and I have little doubt myself but, amongst us, we shall
      be able to succeed." This is one of the oddest schemes ever
      projected by a set of learned and accomplished gentlemen and
      ladies for the benefit of a hypochondriac patient. Its execution
      was prevented by his death. A hurried note from Mrs. Thrale
      announcing the event, beginning, "Write to me, pray for me," is
      endorsed by Madame D'Arblay: "Written a few hours after the death
      of Mr. Thrale, which happened by a sudden stroke of apoplexy, on
      the morning of a day on which half the fashion of London had been
      invited to an intended assembly at his house in Grosvenor
      Square." These invitations had been sent out by his own express
      desire: so little was he aware of his danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters and messages of condolence poured in from all sides.
      Johnson (in a letter dated April 5th) said all that could be said
      in the way of counsel or consolation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not exhort you to reason yourself into tranquillity. We
      must first pray, and then labour; first implore the blessing of
      God, and those means which He puts into our hands. Cultivated
      ground, has few weeds; a mind occupied by lawful business, has
      little room for useless regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We read the will to-day; but I will not fill my first letter
      with any other account than that, with all my <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg137" id="pg137">137</a></span> zeal for your
      advantage, I am satisfied; and that the other executors, more
      used to consider property than I, commended it for wisdom and
      equity. Yet, why should I not tell you that you have five hundred
      pounds for your immediate expenses, and two thousand pounds
      a-year, with both the houses and all the goods?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us pray for one another, that the time, whether long or
      short, that shall yet be granted us, may be well spent; and that
      when this life, which at the longest is very short, shall come to
      an end, a better may begin which shall never end."
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      On April 9th he writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAREST MADAM,&mdash;That you are gradually recovering your
      tranquillity, is the effect to be humbly expected from trust in
      God. Do not represent life as darker than it is. Your loss has
      been very great, but you retain more than almost any other can
      hope to possess. You are high in the opinion of mankind; you have
      children from whom much pleasure may be expected; and that you
      will find many friends, you have no reason to doubt. Of my
      friendship, be it worth more or less, I hope you think yourself
      certain, without much art or care. It will not be easy for me to
      repay the benefits that I have received; but I hope to be always
      ready at your call. Our sorrow has different effects; you are
      withdrawn into solitude, and I am driven into company. <i>I</i>
      am afraid of thinking what I have lost. I never had such a friend
      before. Let me have your prayers and those of my dear Queeny.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg138" id="pg138">138</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "The prudence and resolution of your design to return so soon to
      your business and your duty deserves great praise; I shall
      communicate it on Wednesday to the other executors. Be pleased to
      let me know whether you would have me come to Streatham to
      receive you, or stay here till the next day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was one of the executors and took pride in discharging
      his share of the trust. Mrs. Thrale's account of the pleasure he
      took in signing the documents and cheques, is incidentally
      confirmed by Boswell:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not but be somewhat diverted by hearing Johnson talk in
      a pompous manner of his new office, and particularly of the
      concerns of the brewery, which it was at last resolved should be
      sold. Lord Lucan tells a very good story, which, if not precisely
      exact, is certainly characteristical; that when the sale of
      Thrale's brewery was going forward, Johnson appeared bustling
      about, with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole, like an
      excise-man; and on being asked what he really considered to be
      the value of the property which was to be disposed of, answered,
      'We are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the
      potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The executors had legacies of 200<i>l.</i> each; Johnson, to the
      surprise of his friends, being placed on no better footing than
      the rest. He himself was certainly disappointed. Mrs. Thrale says
      that his complacency towards Thrale was not wholly devoid of
      interested motives; and she adds that his manner towards Reynolds
      and Dr. Taylor was also softened by the vague <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg139" id="pg139">139</a></span> expectation
      of being named in their wills. One of her marginal notes is:
      "Johnson mentioned to Reynolds that he had been told by Taylor he
      was to be his heir. His fondness for Reynolds, ay, and for
      Thrale, had a dash of interest to keep it warm." Again, on his
      saying to Reynolds, "I did not mean to offend you,"&mdash;"He
      never would offend Reynolds: he had his reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many and heavy as were the reproaches subsequently heaped upon
      the widow, no one has accused her of having been found wanting in
      energy, propriety, or self-respect at this period. She took the
      necessary steps for promoting her own interests and those of her
      children with prudence and promptitude. Madame D'Arblay, who was
      carrying on a flirtation with one of the executors (Mr.
      Crutchley), and had personal motives for watching their
      proceedings, writes, April 29th:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Thrale is steady and constant, and very sincerely grieved
      for her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The four executors, Mr. Cator, Mr. Crutchley, Mr. Henry Smith,
      and Dr. Johnson, have all behaved generously and honourably, and
      seem determined to give Mrs. Thrale all the comfort and
      assistance in their power. She is to carry on the business
      jointly with them. Poor soul! it is a dreadful toil and worry to
      her."

      three days a week to attend at the counting-house. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg140" id="pg140">140</a></span> If an angel
      from heaven had told me twenty years ago that the man I knew by
      the name of <i>Dictionary Johnson</i> should one day become
      partner with me in a great trade, and that we should jointly or
      separately sign notes, drafts, &amp;c., for three or four
      thousand pounds of a morning, how unlikely it would have seemed
      ever to happen! Unlikely is no word tho',&mdash;it would have
      seemed <i>incredible</i>, neither of us then being worth a groat,
      God knows, and both as immeasurably removed from commerce as
      birth, literature, and inclination could get us. Johnson,
      however, who desires above all other good the accumulation of new
      ideas, is but too happy with his present employment; and the
      influence I have over him, added to his own solid judgment and a
      regard for truth, will at last find it in a small degree
      difficult to win him from the dirty delight of seeing his name in
      a new character flaming away at the bottom of bonds and leases."

      "Apropos to writing verses in a language one don't understand,
      there is always the allowance given, and that allowance (like our
      excise drawbacks) commonly larger than it ought to be. The
      following translation of the verses written with a knife, has
      been for this reason uncommonly commended, though they have no
      merit except being done quick. Piozzi asked me on Sunday morning
      if ever I had seen them, and could explain them to <i>him</i>,
      for that he heard they were written by his friend Mr. Locke. The
      book in which they were reposited was not ferreted out, however,
      till Monday night, and on Tuesday morning I sent him verses and
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg141" id="pg141">141</a></span>
      translation: we used to think the original was Garrick's, I

      "A very strange thing happened in the year 1776, and I never
      wrote it down,&mdash;I must write it down now. A woman came to
      London from a distant county to prosecute some business, and fell
      into distress; she was sullen and silent, and the people with
      whom her affairs connected her advised her to apply for
      assistance to some friend. What friends can I have in London?
      says the woman, nobody here knows anything of me. One can't tell
      <i>that</i>, was the reply. Where have you lived? I have wandered
      much, says she, but I am originally from Litchfield. Who did you
      know in Litchfield in your youth? Oh, nobody of any note, I'll
      warrant: I knew one <i>David Garrick</i>, indeed, but I once
      heard <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg143" id=
      "pg143">143</a></span> that he turned strolling player, and is
      probably dead long ago; I also knew an obscure man, <i>Samuel
      Johnson</i>, very good he was too; but who can know anything of
      poor Johnson? I was likewise acquainted with <i>Robert James</i>,
      a quack doctor. <i>He</i> is, I suppose, no very reputable
      connection if I could find him. Thus did this woman name and
      discriminate the three best known characters in
      London&mdash;perhaps in Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Such,' says Mrs. Montagu, 'is the dignity of Mrs. Thrale's
      virtue, and such her superiority in all situations of life, that
      nothing now is wanting but an earthquake to show how she will
      behave on <i>that</i> occasion.' Oh, brave Mrs. Montagu! She is a
      monkey, though, to quarrel with Johnson so about Lyttleton's
      life: if he was a great character, nothing said of him in that
      book can hurt him; if he was not a great character, they are
      bustling about nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Crutchley lives now a great deal with me; the business of
      executor to Mr. Thrale's will makes much of his attendance
      necessary, and it begins to have its full effect in seducing and
      attaching him to the house,&mdash;Miss Burney's being always
      about me is probably another reason for his close attendance, and
      I believe it is so. What better could befall Miss Burney, or
      indeed what better could befall <i>him</i>, than to obtain a
      woman of honour, and character, and reputation for superior
      understanding? I would be glad, however, that he fell honestly in
      love with her, and was not trick'd or trapp'd into marriage, poor
      fellow; he is no match for the arts of a novel-writer. A mighty
      particular character <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg144" id=
      "pg144">144</a></span> Mr. Crutchley is: strangely mixed up of
      meanness and magnificence; liberal and splendid in large sums and
      on serious occasions, narrow and confined in the common
      occurrences of life; warm and generous in some of his motives,
      frigid and suspicious, however, for eighteen hours at least out
      of the twenty-four; likely to be duped, though always expecting
      fraud, and easily disappointed in realities, though seldom
      flattered by fancy. He is supposed by those that knew his mother
      and her connections to be Mr. Thrale's natural son, and in many
      things he resembles him, but not in person: as he is both ugly
      and awkward. Mr. Thrale certainly believed he was his son, and
      once told me as much when Sophy Streatfield's affair was in
      question but nobody could persuade him to court the S.S. Oh! well

      have sold my brewhouse to Barclay, the rich Quaker, for
      135,000<i>l</i>., to be in four years' time paid. I have by this
      bargain purchased peace and a stable fortune, restoration to my
      original rank in life, and a situation undisturbed by commercial
      jargon, unpolluted by commercial frauds, undisgraced by

      "On this principle partly, and partly on worse, was dear Mr.
      Johnson something unwilling&mdash;but not much at last&mdash;to
      give up a trade by which in some years 15,000<i>l.</i> or
      16,000<i>l.</i> had undoubtedly been got, but by which, in some
      years, its possessor had suffered agonies of terror and tottered
      twice upon the verge of bankruptcy. Well! if thy own conscience
      acquit, who shall condemn thee? Not, I hope, the future husbands
      of our daughters, though I should think it likely enough;
      however, as Johnson says very judiciously, they must either think
      right or wrong: if they think right, let us now think with them;
      if wrong, let us never care what they think. So adieu to
      brewhouse, and borough wintering; adieu to trade, and tradesmen's
      frigid approbation; may virtue and wisdom sanctify our contract,
      and make buyer and seller happy in the bargain!"
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] There is a curious similarity here to Johnson's phrase,
        "the potentiality of becoming rich beyond the dreams of
        avarice."

      After mentioning some friends who disapproved of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg146" id="pg146">146</a></span> the sale, she
      adds: "Mrs. Montagu has sent me her approbation in a letter
      exceedingly affectionate and polite. 'Tis over now, tho', and
      I'll clear my head of it and all that belongs to it; I will go to
      church, give God thanks, receive the sacrament and forget the
      frauds, follies, and inconveniences of a commercial life this
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay was at Streatham on the day of the sale, and
      gives a dramatic colour to the ensuing scene:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, Thursday</i>.&mdash;This was the great and most
      important day to all this house, upon which the sale of the
      brewery was to be decided. Mrs. Thrale went early to town, to
      meet all the executors, and Mr. Barclay, the Quaker, who was the
      <i>bidder</i>. She was in great agitation of mind, and told me,
      if all went well she would wave a white pocket-handkerchief out
      of the coach window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four o'clock came and dinner was ready, and no Mrs. Thrale. Five
      o'clock followed, and no Mrs. Thrale. Queeny and I went out upon
      the lawn, where we sauntered, in eager expectation, till near
      six, and then the coach appeared in sight, and a white
      pocket-handkerchief was waved from it. I ran to the door of it to
      meet her, and she jumped out of it, and gave me a thousand
      embraces while I gave my congratulations. We went instantly to
      her dressing-room, where she told me, in brief, how the matter
      had been transacted, and then we went down to dinner. Dr. Johnson
      and Mr. Crutchley had accompanied her home." <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg147" id="pg147">147</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The event is thus announced to Langton by Johnson, in a letter
      printed by Boswell, dated June 16, 1781: "You will perhaps be
      glad to hear that Mrs. Thrale is disencumbered of her brewhouse,
      and that it seemed to the purchaser so far from an evil that he
      was content to give for it 135,000<i>l</i>. Is the nation
      ruined." <i>Marginal note</i>: "I suppose he was neither glad nor
      sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrale died on the 4th April, 1781, and Mrs. Thrale left
      Streatham on the 7th October, 1782. The intervening eighteen
      months have been made the subject of an almost unprecedented
      amount of misrepresentation. Hawkins, Boswell, Madame D'Arblay,
      and Lord Macaulay have vied with each other in founding
      uncharitable imputations on her conduct at this period of her
      widowhood; and it has consequently become necessary to
      recapitulate the authentic evidence relating to it. As Piozzi's
      name will occur occasionally, he must now be brought upon the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is first mentioned in "Thraliana" thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Brighton, July</i>, 1780.&mdash;I have picked up Piozzi here,
      the great Italian singer. He is amazingly like my father. He
      shall teach Hester."
    </p>
    <p>
      A detailed account of the commencement of the acquaintance is
      given in one of the autobiographical fragments. She says he was
      recommended to her by letter by Madame D'Arblay as "a man likely
      to lighten the burthen of life to her," and that both she and Mr.
      Thrale took to him at once. Madame D'Arblay is silent as to the
      introduction or recommendation; but gives an amusing account of
      one of their first meetings: <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg148" id="pg148">148</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few months after the Streathamite morning visit to St.
      Martin's Street, an evening party was arranged by Dr. Burney, for
      bringing thither again Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale, at the desire
      of Mr. and Mrs. Greville and Mrs. Crewe; who wished, under the
      quiet roof of Dr. Burney, to make acquaintance with these
      celebrated personages." The conversation flagged, and recourse
      was had to music&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Piozzi, a first-rate singer, whose voice was deliciously sweet,
      and whose expression was perfect, sung in his very best manner,
      from his desire to do honour to <i>il Capo di Casa</i>; but <i>il
      Capo di Casa</i> and his family alone did justice to his strains:
      neither the Grevilles nor the Thrales heeded music beyond what
      belonged to it as fashion: the expectations of the Grevilles were
      all occupied by Dr. Johnson; and those of the Thrales by the
      authoress of the Ode to Indifference. When Piozzi, therefore,
      arose, the party remained as little advanced in any method or
      pleasure for carrying on the evening, as upon its first entrance
      into the room....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Burney now began to feel considerably embarrassed; though
      still he cherished hopes of ultimate relief from some auspicious
      circumstance that, sooner or later, would operate, he hoped, in
      his favour, through the magnetism of congenial talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vainly, however, he sought to elicit some observations that
      might lead to disserting discourse; all his attempts received
      only quiet, acquiescent replies, 'signifying nothing.' Every one
      was awaiting some spontaneous opening from Dr. Johnson.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg149" id="pg149">149</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale, of the whole coterie, was alone at her ease. She
      feared not Dr. Johnson; for fear made no part of her composition;
      and with Mrs. Greville, as a fair rival genius, she would have
      been glad, from curiosity, to have had the honour of a little
      tilt, in full carelessness of its event; for though triumphant
      when victorious, she had spirits so volatile, and such utter
      exemption from envy or spleen, that she was gaily free from
      mortification when vanquished. But she knew the meeting to have
      been fabricated for Dr. Johnson; and, therefore, though not
      without difficulty, constrained herself to be passive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When, however, she observed the sardonic disposition of Mr.
      Greville to stare around him at the whole company in curious
      silence, she felt a defiance against his aristocracy beat in
      every pulse; for, however grandly he might look back to the long
      ancestry of the Brookes and the Grevilles, she had a glowing
      consciousness that her own blood, rapid and fluent, flowed in her
      veins from Adam of Saltsberg; and, at length, provoked by the
      dullness of a taciturnity that, in the midst of such renowned
      interlocutors, produced as narcotic a torpor as could have been
      caused by a dearth the most barren of human faculties; she grew
      tired of the music, and yet more tired of remaining, what as
      little suited her inclinations as her abilities, a mere cipher in
      the company; and, holding such a position, and all its
      concomitants, to be ridiculous, her spirits rose rebelliously
      above her control; and, in a fit of utter recklessness of what
      might be thought of her by her fine new acquaintance,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg150" id="pg150">150</a></span>
      she suddenly, but softly, arose, and stealing on tip-toe behind
      Signor Piozzi, who was accompanying himself on the piano-forte to
      an animated <i>arria parlante</i>, with his back to the company,
      and his face to the wall; she ludicrously began imitating him by
      squaring her elbows, elevating them with ecstatic shrugs of the
      shoulders, and casting up her eyes, while languishingly reclining
      her head; as if she were not less enthusiastically, though
      somewhat more suddenly, struck with the transports of harmony
      than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This grotesque ebullition of ungovernable gaiety was not
      perceived by Dr. Johnson, who faced the fire, with his back to
      the performer and the instrument. But the amusement which such an
      unlooked for exhibition caused to the party, was momentary; for
      Dr. Burney, shocked lest the poor Signor should observe, and be
      hurt by this mimicry, glided gently round to Mrs. Thrale, and,
      with something between pleasantness and severity, whispered to
      her, 'Because, Madam, you have no ear yourself for music, will
      you destroy the attention of all who, in that one point, are
      otherwise gifted?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was now that shone the brightest attribute of Mrs. Thrale,
      sweetness of temper. She took this rebuke with a candour, and a
      sense of its justice the most amiable: she nodded her approbation
      of the admonition; and, returning to her chair, quietly sat down,
      as she afterwards said, like a pretty little miss, for the
      remainder of one of the most humdrum evenings that she had ever
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange, indeed, strange and most strange, the event
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg151" id="pg151">151</a></span>
      considered, was this opening intercourse between Mrs. Thrale and
      Signor Piozzi. Little could she imagine that the person she was
      thus called away from holding up to ridicule, would become, but a
      few years afterwards, the idol of her fancy and the lord of her
      destiny! And little did the company present imagine, that this
      burlesque scene was but the first of a drama the most
      extraordinary of real life, of which these two persons were to be
      the hero and heroine: though, when the catastrophe was known,
      this incident, witnessed by so many, was recollected and repeated
      from coterie to coterie throughout London, with comments and
      sarcasms of endless variety."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay mentioned the same circumstance in conversation
      to the Rev. W. Harness: yet it seems strange in connection with
      an entry in "Thraliana" from which it would appear that her
      friend was far from wanting in susceptibility to sweet sounds:
    </p>
    <p>
      "13 <i>August</i>, 1780.&mdash;Piozzi is become a prodigious
      favourite with me, he is so intelligent a creature, so
      discerning, one can't help wishing for his good opinion; his
      singing surpasses everybody's for taste, tenderness, and true
      elegance; his hand on the forte piano too is so soft, so sweet,
      so delicate, every tone goes to the heart, I think, and fills the
      mind with emotions one would not be without, though inconvenient
      enough sometimes. He wants nothing from us: he comes for his
      health he says: I see nothing ail the man but pride. The
      newspapers <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg152" id=
      "pg152">152</a></span> yesterday told what all the musical folks
      gained, and set Piozzi down 1200<i>l</i>. o' year."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 24th August, 1780, Madame D'Arblay writes: "I have not
      seen Piozzi: he left me your letter, which indeed is a charming
      one, though its contents puzzled me much whether to make me sad
      or merry." Mrs. Thrale was still at Brighton; so that the scene
      at Dr. Burney's must have occurred subsequently; when she had
      already begun to find Piozzi what the Neapolitan ladies
      understand by <i>simpatico</i>. Madame D'Arblay's "Memoirs," as I
      shall have occasion to point out, are by no means so trustworthy
      a register of dates, facts, or impressions as her "Diary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Thrale lived, Mrs. Thrale's regard for Piozzi was
      certainly not of a nature to cause scandal or provoke censure,
      and as it ripened into love, it may be traced, step by step, from
      the frankest and fullest of all possible unveilings of the heart.
      Rare indeed are the instances in which such revelations as we
      find in "Thraliana" could be risked by either man or woman,
      without giving scope to malevolence; and they should not only be
      judged as a whole and by the context, but the most favourable
      construction should be put upon them. When, in this sort of
      self-communing, every passing emotion, every transitory
      inclination, is set down, it would be unfair and even foolish to
      infer that the emotion at once became a passion, or that the
      inclination was criminally indulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next notice of Piozzi occurs in Madame D'Arblay's "Diary" for
      July 10th, 1781: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg153" id=
      "pg153">153</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will believe I was not a little surprised to see Sacchini.
      He is going to the Continent with Piozzi, and Mrs. Thrale invited
      them both to spend the last day at Streatham, and from hence
      proceed to Margate.... The first song he sang, beginning 'En quel
      amabil volto,' you may perhaps know, but I did not; it is a
      charming mezza bravura. He and Piozzi then sung together the duet
      of the 'Amore Soldato;' and nothing could be much more
      delightful; Piozzi taking pains to sing his very best, and
      Sacchini, with his soft but delicious whisper, almost thrilling
      me by his exquisite and pathetic expression. They then went
      through that opera, great part of 'Creso,' some of 'Erifile,' and
      much of 'Rinaldo.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Piozzi's attentions had attracted Johnson's notice without
      troubling his peace. On November 24th, 1781, he wrote from
      Ashbourne: "Piozzi, I find, is coming in spite of Miss Harriet's
      prediction, or second sight, and when <i>he</i> comes and
      <i>I</i> come, you will have two about you that love you; and I
      question if either of us heartily care how few more you have. But
      how many soever they may be, I hope you keep your kindness for
      me, and I have a great mind to have Queeny's kindness too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, December 3rd, 1781: "You have got Piozzi again,
      notwithstanding pretty Harriet's dire denunciations. The Italian
      translation which he has brought, you will find no great
      accession to your library, for the writer seems to understand
      very little English. When we meet we can compare some passages.
      Pray contrive a multitude of good things for us to do when we
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg154" id="pg154">154</a></span>
      meet. Something that may <i>hold all together</i>; though if any
      thing makes <i>me</i> love you more, it is going from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      We learn from "Thraliana," that the entanglement with Piozzi was
      not the only one of which Streatham was contemporaneously the
      scene:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>August,</i> 1781.&mdash;I begin to wish in good earnest that
      Miss Burney should make impression on Mr. Crutchley. I think she
      honestly loves the man, who in his turn appears to be in love
      with some one else&mdash;Hester, I fear, Oh! that would indeed be
      unlucky! People have said so a long while, but I never thought it
      till now; young men and women will always be serving one so, to
      be sure, if they live at all together, but I depended on Burney
      keeping him steady to herself. Queeny behaves like an angel about
      it. Mr. Johnson says the name of Crutchley comes from <i>croix
      lea</i>, the cross meadow; <i>lea</i> is a meadow, I know, and
      <i>crutch</i>, a crutch stick, is so called from having the
      handle go <i>crosswise</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>September,</i> 1781.&mdash;My five fair daughters too! I have
      so good a pretence to wish for long life to see them settled.
      Like the old fellow in 'Lucian,' one is never at a loss for an
      excuse. They are five lovely creatures to be sure, but they love
      not me. Is it my fault or theirs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>12th October</i>, 1781.&mdash;Yesterday was my wedding-day;
      it was a melancholy thing to me to pass it without the husband of
      my youth. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg155" id=

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "<i>15th October</i>, 1781.&mdash;My maid Margaret Rice dreamed
      last night that my eldest daughter was going to be married to Mr.
      Crutchley, but that Mr. Thrale <i>himself</i> prevented her. An
      odd thing to me, who think Mr. Crutchley is his son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the next day but one after Thrale's death Johnson
      carried Boswell to dine at the Queen's Arms' Club, his grief was
      deep and durable. Indeed, it is expressed so often and so
      earnestly as to rebut the presumption that "my mistress" was the
      sole or chief tie which bound him to Streatham. Amongst his
      Prayers and Meditations is the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Good Friday, April 13th</i>, 1781.&mdash;On Wednesday, 11th,
      was buried my dear friend Thrale, who died on Wednesday, 4th; and
      with him were buried many of my hopes and pleasures. About five,
      I think, on Wednesday morning, he expired. I felt almost the last
      flutter of his pulse, and looked for the last time upon the face
      that for fifteen years had never been turned upon me but with
      respect or benignity. Farewell. May God, that delighteth in
      mercy, have had mercy on <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg156"
      id="pg156">156</a></span> thee! I had constantly prayed for him
      some time before his death. The decease of him, from whose
      friendship I had obtained many opportunities of amusement, and to
      whom I turned my thoughts as to a refuge from misfortunes, has
      left me heavy. But my business is with myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same paper is a note: "My first knowledge of Thrale was in
      1765. I enjoyed his favours for almost a fourth part of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 20th March, 1782, he wrote thus to Langton:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of my life, from the time we parted, the history is mournful.
      The spring of last year deprived me of Thrale, a man whose eye
      for fifteen years had scarcely been turned upon me but with
      respect or tenderness; for such another friend, the general
      course of human things will not suffer man to hope. I passed the
      summer at Streatham, but there was no Thrale; and having idled
      away the summer with a weakly body and neglected mind, I made a
      journey to Staffordshire on the edge of winter. The season was
      dreary, I was sickly, and found the friends sickly whom I went to
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is ample evidence that he neither felt nor suspected any
      diminution of kindness or regard, and continued, till their final
      departure from Streatham, to treat it as his home.
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      In November she writes, "Do not forget Streatham and its
      inhabitants, who are all much yours;" and he replies:

      confession must precede amendment. Do not study to be more
      unhappy than you are, and if you can eat and sleep well, do not

      excellent pun than his, when some one told him how, in a late
      dispute among the Privy Counsellors, the Lord Chancellor
      (Thurlow) struck the table with such violence that he split it.
      'No, no,' replied the Master, drily, 'I can hardly persuade
      myself that he <i>split the table</i>, though I believe he
      <i>divided the Board</i>.' Will you send me anything better from
      Oxford than this? for there must be no more fastidiousness now;

      Johnson, who had been in town some days, returned, and Mr.
      Crutchley came also, as well as my father." After describing some
      lively conversation, she adds: "I have <i>very often</i>, though
      I <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg161" id="pg161">161</a></span>
      mention them not, long and melancholy discourses with Dr.
      Johnson, about our dear deceased master, whom, indeed, he regrets
      unceasingly; but I love not to dwell on subjects of sorrow when I
      can drive them away, especially to you (her sister), upon this
      account as you were so much a stranger to that excellent friend,
      whom you only lamented for the sake of those who survived him."
      He had only returned that very day, and she had been absent from
      Streatham, as she states elsewhere, till "the Cecilian business
      was arranged," <i>i.e.</i> till the end of May.
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      On the 24th August, 1782 (this date is material) Johnson writes
      to Boswell:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR SIR,&mdash;Being uncertain whether I should have any call
      this autumn into the country, I did not immediately answer your
      kind letter. I have no call; but if you desire to meet me at
      Ashbourne, I believe I can come thither; if you had rather come
      to London, I can stay at Streatham: take your choice."

    <p>
      This was two days after Mrs. Thrale, with his full concurrence,
      had made up her mind to let Streatham. He treats it,

      she remains in it.

      looks thin and battered, but always kindly upon me, I think. He
      brought me an Italian sonnet written in his praise by Marco
      Capello, which I instantly translated of course; but he, prudent
      creature, insisted on my burning it, as he said it would
      inevitably get about the town how <i>he</i> was praised, and how
      Mrs. Thrale translated and echoed the praises, so that, says he,
      I shall be torn in pieces, and you will have some <i>infamità</i>
      said of you that will make you hate the sight of me. He was so
      earnest with me that I could not resist, so burnt my sonnet,
      which was actually very pretty; and now I repent I did not first
      write it into the Thraliana. Over leaf, however, shall go the

    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Harley Street, 13th April, 1782.</i>&mdash;When I took off my
      mourning, the watchers watched me very exactly, 'but they whose
      hands were mightiest have found nothing:' so I shall leave the
      town, I hope, in a good disposition towards me, though I am
      sullen enough with the town for fancying me such an amorous idiot
      that I am dying to enjoy every filthy fellow. God knows how
      distant such dispositions are from the heart and constitution of
      H.L.T. Lord Loughboro', Sir Richard Jebb, Mr. Piozzi, Mr. Selwyn,
      Dr. Johnson, every man that comes to the house, is put in the
      papers <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg168" id=
      "pg168">168</a></span> for me to marry. In good time, I wrote
      to-day to beg the 'Morning Herald' would say no more about me,
      good or bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Streatham, 17th April, 1782.</i>&mdash;I am returned to
      Streatham, pretty well in health and very sound in heart,
      notwithstanding the watchers and the wager-layers, who think more
      of the charms of their sex by half than I who know them better.
      Love and friendship are distinct things, and I would go through
      fire to serve many a man whom nothing less than fire would force
      me to go to bed to. Somebody mentioned my going to be married
      t'other day, and Johnson was joking about it. I suppose, Sir,
      said I, they think they are doing me honour with these imaginary
      matches, when, perhaps the man does not exist who would do me
      honour by marrying me! This, indeed, was said in the wild and
      insolent spirit of Baretti, yet 'tis nearer the truth than one
      would think for. A woman of passable person, ancient family,
      respectable character, uncommon talents, and three thousand a
      year, has a right to think herself any man's equal, and has
      nothing to seek but return of affection from whatever partner she
      pitches on. To marry for love would therefore be rational in me,
      who want no advancement of birth or fortune, and <i>till I am in
      love</i>, I will not marry, nor perhaps then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>22nd August, 1782.</i>&mdash;An event of no small consequence
      to our little family must here be recorded in the 'Thraliana.'
      After having long intended to go to Italy for pleasure, we are
      now settling to go thither for convenience. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg169" id="pg169">169</a></span> The
      establishment of expense here at Streatham is more than my income
      will answer; my lawsuit with Lady Salusbury turns out worse in
      the event and infinitely more costly than I could have dreamed
      on; 8000<i>l.</i> is supposed necessary to the payment of it, and
      how am I to raise 8000<i>l</i>.? My trees will (after all my
      expectations from them) fetch but 4000<i>l</i>., the money lent
      Perkins on his bond 1600<i>l</i>., the Hertfordshire copyholds
      may perhaps be worth 1000<i>l</i>., and where is the rest to
      spring from? I must go abroad and save money. To show Italy to my
      girls, and be showed it by Piozzi, has long been my dearest wish,
      but to leave Mr. Johnson shocked me, and to take him appeared
      impossible. His recovery, however, from an illness we all thought
      dangerous, gave me courage to speak to him on the subject, and
      this day (after having been let blood) I mustered up resolution
      to tell him the necessity of changing a way of life I had long
      been displeased with. I added that I had mentioned the matter to
      my eldest daughter, whose prudence and solid judgment, unbiassed
      by passion, is unequalled, as far as my experience has reached;
      that she approved the scheme, and meant to partake it, though of
      an age when she might be supposed to form connections here in
      England&mdash;attachments of the tenderest nature; that she
      declared herself free and resolved to follow my fortunes, though
      perfectly aware temptations might arise to prevent me from ever
      returning&mdash;a circumstance she even mentioned herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Johnson thought well of the project, and wished <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg170" id="pg170">170</a></span> me to put it
      early in execution: seemed less concerned at parting with me than
      I wished him: thought his pupil Miss Thrale quite right in
      forbearing to marry young, and seemed to entertain no doubt of
      living to see us return rich and happy in two or three years'
      time. He told Hester in my absence that he would not go with me
      if I asked him. See the importance of a person to himself. I
      fancied Mr. Johnson could not have existed without me, forsooth,
      as we have now lived together for above eighteen years. I have so
      fondled him in sickness and in health. Not a bit of it. He feels
      nothing in parting with me, nothing in the least; but thinks it a
      prudent scheme, and goes to his books as usual. This is
      philosophy and truth; he always said he hated a <i>feeler</i>....
    </p>
    <p>
      "The persecution I endure from men too who want to marry
      me&mdash;in good time&mdash;is another reason for my desiring to
      be gone. I wish to marry none of them, and Sir Philip's teazing
      me completed my mortification; to see that one can rely on
      <i>nobody!</i> The expences of this house, however, which are
      quite past my power to check, is the true and rational cause of
      our departure. In Italy we shall live with twice the respect and
      at half the expence we do here; the language is familiar to me
      and I love the Italians; I take with me all I love in the world
      except my two baby daughters, who will be left safe at school;
      and since Mr. Johnson cares nothing for the loss of my personal
      friendship and company, there is no danger of any body else
      breaking their hearts. My sweet Burney <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg171" id="pg171">171</a></span> and Mrs.
      Byron will perhaps think they are sorry, but my consciousness
      that no one <i>can</i> have the cause of concern that Johnson
      has, and my conviction that he has <i>no concern at all</i>,
      shall cure me of lamenting friends left behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the margin of this entry she has written, "I begin to see (now
      everything shows it) that Johnson's connection with me is merely
      an interested one; he <i>loved</i> Mr. Thrale, I believe, but
      only wished to find in me a careful nurse and humble friend for
      his sick and his lounging hours; yet I really thought he could
      not have <i>existed</i> without <i>my conversation</i> forsooth!
      He cares more for my roast beef and plum pudden, which he now
      devours too dirtily for endurance; and since he is glad to get
      rid of me, I'm sure I have good cause to desire the getting rid
      of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      No great stress should be laid on this ebullition of mortified
      self-love; but it occurs oddly enough at the very time when,
      according to Lord Macaulay, she was labouring to produce the very
      feeling that irritated her.

    <p>
      "<i>August 28th</i>, 1782.&mdash;He (Piozzi) thinks still more
      than he says, that I shall give him up; and if Queeney made
      herself more amiable to me, and took the proper methods&mdash;I
      suppose I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>20 September</i> 1782, <i>Streatham</i>.&mdash;And now I am
      going to leave Streatham (I have let the house and grounds to
      Lord Shelburne, the expence of it eat me up) for three years,
      where I lived&mdash;never happily indeed, but always easily: the
      more so perhaps from the total absence of love and

      But if he is ever so worthy, ever so lovely, he is <i>below

      below me in birth, and so is almost every man I know or have a
      chance to know. But he is below me in fortune: is mine sufficient
      for us both?&mdash;more than amply so. Does he deserve it by his
      conduct, in which he has always united warm notions of honour
      with cool attention to oeconomy, the spirit of a gentleman with
      the talents of a professor? How shall any man deserve fortune, if

      now?&mdash;Not <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg173" id=
      "pg173">173</a></span> at all; but I am not to think about
      myself; I married the first time to please my mother, I must
      marry the second time to please my daughter. I have always
      sacrificed my own choice to that of others, so I must sacrifice
      it again: but why? Oh, because I am a woman of superior
      understanding, and must not for the world degrade myself from my
      situation in life. But if I <i>have</i> superior understanding,
      let me at least make use of it for once, and rise to the rank of
      a human being conscious of its own power to discern good from
      ill. The person who has uniformly acted by the will of others has
      hardly that dignity to boast.

      "But once again: I am guardian to five girls; agreed: will this
      connection prejudice their bodies, souls, or purse? My marriage
      may assist <i>my</i> health, but I suppose it will not injure
      <i>theirs</i>. Will his company or companions corrupt their
      morals? God forbid; if I did not believe him one of the best of
      our fellow beings, I would reject him instantly. Can it injure
      their fortunes? Could he impoverish (if he would) five women, to
      whom their father left <i>20,000l.</i> each, independent almost
      of possibilities?&mdash;To what then am I guardian? to their
      pride and prejudice? and is anything else affected by the
      alliance? Now for more solid objections. Is not the man of whom I
      desire protection, a foreigner? unskilled in the laws and
      language of our country? Certainly. Is he not, as the French say,
      <i>Arbitre de mon sort?</i> and from the hour he possesses my
      person and fortune, have I any power of decision how or where I
      may continue or end my life? Is not the man, upon the continuance
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg174" id="pg174">174</a></span>
      of whose affection my whole happiness depends, <i>younger</i>
      than myself<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and is it wise to
      place one's happiness on the continuance of <i>any</i> man's
      affection? Would it not be painful to owe his appearance of
      regard more to his honour than his love? and is not my person,
      already faded, likelier to fade sooner, than his? On the other
      hand, is his life a good one? and would it not be lunacy even to
      risque the wretchedness of losing all situation in the world for
      the sake of living with a man one loves, and then to lose both
      companion and consolation? When I lost Mr. Thrale, every one was
      officious to comfort and to soothe me; but which of my children
      or quondam friends would look with kindness upon Piozzi's widow?
      If I bring children by him, must they not be Catholics, and must
      not I live among people the <i>ritual</i> part of whose religion
      I disapprove?

      in trifles I do not approve. Every one is made insolent, and no

      my health unsettled. I will, however, resolve on nothing. I will
      take a voyage to the Continent in spring, enlarge my knowledge
      and repose my purse. Change of place may turn the course of these
      ideas, and external objects supply the room of internal felicity.
      If he follow me, I may reject or receive at pleasure the
      addresses of a man who follows on <i>no explicit promise</i>, nor
      much probability of success, for I would really wish to marry no
      more without the consent of my children (such I mean as are
      qualified to give their opinions); and how should <i>Miss
      Thrales</i> approve of my marrying <i>Mr. Piozzi</i>? Here then I
      rest, and will torment my mind no longer, but commit myself, as
      he advises, to the hand of Providence, and all will end <i>all'

      island. I am more and more disposed to try the continent. One day
      the paper rings with my marriage to Johnson, one day to
      Crutchley, one day to Seward. I give no reason for such
      impertinence, but cannot deliver myself from it. Whitbred, the
      rich brewer, is in love with me too; oh, I would rather, as Ann
      Page says, be set breast deep in the earth<span class=

      "Philip Thicknesse put it about Bath that I was a poor girl, a

      The general result down to this point is that, whatever the
      disturbance in Mrs. Thrale's heart and mind, Johnson had no
      ground of complaint, nor ever thought he had, which is the
      essential point in controversy. In other words, he was not
      driven, hinted, or manoeuvred out of Streatham. Yet almost all
      his worshippers have insisted that he was. Hawkins, after
      mentioning the kind offices undertaken by Johnson (which
      constantly took him to Streatham) says:&mdash;"Nevertheless it
      was observed by myself, and other of Johnson's friends, that soon
      after the decease of Mr. Thrale, his visits to Streatham became
      less and less frequent, and that he studiously avoided the
      mention of the place or the family." This statement is
      preposterous, and is only to be partially accounted for by the
      fact that Hawkins, as his daughter informs us, had no personal
      acquaintance with Mrs. Thrale or Streatham. Boswell, who was in
      Scotland when Johnson and Mrs. Thrale left Streatham together,
      gratuitously infers that he left it alone, angry and mortified,
      in consequence of her altered manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The death of Mr. Thrale had made a very material alteration with
      respect to Johnson's reception in that <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg177" id="pg177">177</a></span> family. The
      manly authority of the husband no longer curbed the lively
      exuberance of the lady; and as her vanity had been fully
      gratified, by having the Colossus of Literature attached to her
      for many years, she gradually became less assiduous to please
      him. Whether her attachment to him was already divided by another
      object, I am unable to ascertain; but it is plain that Johnson's
      penetration was alive to her neglect or forced attention; for on
      the 6th of October this year we find him making a 'parting use of
      the library' at Streatham, and pronouncing a prayer which he
      composed on leaving Mr. Thrale's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Almighty God, Father of all mercy, help me by Thy grace, that I
      may, with humble and sincere thankfulness, remember the comforts
      and conveniences which I have enjoyed at this place; and that I
      may resign them with holy submission, equally trusting in Thy
      protection when Thou givest, and when Thou takest away. Have
      mercy upon me, O Lord! have mercy upon me! To Thy fatherly
      protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and
      defend them, that they may so pass through this world, as finally
      to enjoy in Thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus
      Christ's sake. Amen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "One cannot read this prayer without some emotions not very
      favourable to the lady whose conduct occasioned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day, he made the following memorandum:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'<i>October 7.</i>&mdash;I was called early. I packed up my
      bundles, and used the foregoing prayer, with my morning
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg178" id="pg178">178</a></span>
      devotions somewhat, I think, enlarged. Being earlier than the
      family, I read St. Paul's farewell in the Acts, and then read
      fortuitously in the Gospels,&mdash;which was my parting use of
      the library.'"

      Mr. Croker, whose protest against the groundless insinuations of
      Boswell should have put subsequent writers on their guard, states
      in a note:&mdash;"He seems to have taken leave of the kitchen as
      well as the church at Streatham in Latin." The note of his last
      dinner there, done into English, would run thus:

      "I dined at Streatham on boiled leg of lamb, with spinach, the
      stuffing of flour and raisins, round of beef, and turkey poult;
      and after the meat service, figs, grapes, not yet ripe in
      consequence of the bad season, with peaches, also hard. I took my
      place at table in no joyful mood, and partook of the food
      moderately, lest I should finish by intemperance. If I rightly
      remember, the banquet at the funeral of Hadon came into my
      mind.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> When shall I revisit

      conveyed the Memorialist to Streatham. No further reluctance on
      his part, nor exhortations on that of Mr. Crisp, sought to
      withdraw her from that spot, where, while it was in its glory,
      they had so recently, and with pride, seen her distinguished. And
      truly eager was her own haste, when mistress of her time, to try
      once more to soothe those sorrows and chagrins in which she had
      most largely participated, by answering to the call, which had
      never ceased tenderly to pursue her, of return.

      "With alacrity, therefore, though not with gaiety, they
      re-entered the Streatham gates&mdash;but they soon perceived that
      they found not what they had left!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Changed, indeed, was Streatham! Gone its chief, and changed his
      relict! unaccountably, incomprehensibly, indefinably changed! She
      was absent and agitated; not two minutes could she remain in a
      place; she scarcely seemed to know whom she saw; her speech was
      so hurried it was hardly intelligible; her eyes were assiduously
      averted from those who sought them; and her smiles were faint and
      forced."

      "The astonishing history of the enigmatical attachment which
      impelled Mrs. Thrale to her second marriage, is now as well known
      as her name: but its details belong not to the history of Dr.
      Burney; though the fact too deeply interested him, and was too
      intimately felt in his social habits, to be passed over in
      silence in any memoirs of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But while ignorant yet of its cause, more and more struck he
      became at every meeting, by a species of general alienation which
      pervaded all around at Streatham. His visits, which, heretofore,
      had seemed galas to Mrs. Thrale, were now begun and ended almost
      without notice: and all others,&mdash;Dr. Johnson not
      excepted,&mdash;were cast into the same gulph of general neglect,
      or forgetfulness;&mdash;all,&mdash;save singly this
      Memorialist!&mdash;to whom, the fatal secret once acknowledged,
      Mrs. Thrale clung for comfort; though she saw, and generously
      pardoned, how wide she was from meeting approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this retired, though far from tranquil manner, <i>passed many
      months; during which</i>, with the acquiescent consent of the
      Doctor, his daughter, wholly devoted to her unhappy friend,
      <i>remained uninterruptedly at sad and altered Streatham;</i>
      sedulously avoiding, what at other times she most wished, a
      <i>tête-à-tête</i> with her father. Bound by ties indissoluble of
      honour not to betray a trust that, in the ignorance of her pity,
      she had herself unwittingly sought, even to him she was as
      immutably silent, on this subject, as to all others&mdash;save,
      singly, to the eldest daughter of the house: <span class=

      conduct, through scenes of dreadful difficulty, notwithstanding
      her extreme youth, was even exemplary; and to whom the
      self-beguiled, yet generous mother, gave full and free permission
      to confide every thought and feeling to the Memorialist."

    <hr />
    <p>
      "Various incidental circumstances began, at length, to open the
      reluctant eyes of Dr. Burney to an impelled, though clouded
      foresight, of the portentous event which might latently be the
      cause of the alteration of all around at Streatham. He then
      naturally wished for some explanation with his daughter, though
      he never forced, or even claimed her confidence; well knowing,
      that voluntarily to give it him had been her earliest delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in taking her home with him one morning, to pass a day in
      St. Martin's Street, he almost involuntarily, in driving from the
      paddock, turned back his head towards the house, and, in a tone
      the most impressive, sighed out: 'Adieu,
      Streatham!&mdash;Adieu!'"

    <hr />
    <p>
      "<i>A few weeks earlier</i>, the Memorialist had passed a nearly
      similar scene with Dr. Johnson. Not, however, she believes, from
      the same formidable species of surmise; but from the wounds
      inflicted upon his injured sensibility, through the palpably
      altered looks, tone, and deportment, of the bewildered lady of
      the mansion; who, cruelly aware what would be his wrath, and how
      overwhelming his reproaches against her projected <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg182" id="pg182">182</a></span> union, wished
      to break up their residing under the same roof before it should
      be proclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This gave to her whole behaviour towards Dr. Johnson, a sort of
      restless petulancy, of which she was sometimes hardly conscious,
      at others, nearly reckless; but which hurt him far more than she
      purposed, <i>though short of the point at which she aimed</i>, of
      precipitating a change of dwelling that would elude its being
      cast, either by himself or the world, upon a passion that her
      understanding blushed to own, even while she was sacrificing to
      it all of inborn dignity that she had been bred to hold most
      sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Johnson, while still uninformed of an entanglement it was
      impossible he should conjecture, attributed her varying humours
      to the effect of wayward health meeting a sort of sudden wayward
      power: and imagined that caprices, which he judged to be partly
      feminine, <i>and partly wealthy</i>, would soberise themselves
      away in being unnoticed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But at length, as she became more and more dissatisfied with her
      own situation, and impatient for its relief, she grew less and
      less scrupulous with regard to her celebrated guest: she slighted
      his counsel; did not heed his remonstrances; avoided his society;
      was ready at a moment's hint to lend him her carriage when he
      wished to return to Bolt Court; but awaited a formal request to
      accord it for bringing him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Doctor then began to be stung; his own aspect became
      altered; and depression, with indignant uneasiness, sat upon his
      venerable front. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg183" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      "It was at this moment that, finding the Memorialist was going
      one morning to St. Martin's Street, he desired a cast thither in
      the carriage, and then to be set down at Bolt Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aware of his disturbance, and far too well aware how short it
      was of what it would become when the cause of all that passed
      should be detected, it was in trembling that the Memorialist
      accompanied him to the coach, filled with dread of offending him
      by any reserve, should he force upon her any inquiry; and yet
      impressed with the utter impossibility of betraying a trusted
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His look was stern, though dejected, as he followed her into the
      vehicle; but when his eye, which, however short-sighted, was
      quick to mental perception, saw how ill at ease appeared his
      companion, all sternness subsided into an undisguised expression
      of the strongest emotion, that seemed to claim her sympathy,
      though to revolt from her compassion; while, with a shaking hand,
      and pointing finger, he directed her looks to the mansion from
      which they were driving; and, when they faced it from the coach
      window, as they turned into Streatham Common, tremulously
      exclaiming: 'That house ... is lost to <i>me</i>&mdash;for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "During a moment he then fixed upon her an interrogative eye,
      that impetuously demanded: 'Do you not perceive the change I am
      experiencing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sorrowing sigh was her only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pride and delicacy then united to make him leave her to her
      taciturnity. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg184" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      "He was too deeply, however, disturbed to start or to bear any
      other subject; and neither of them uttered a single word till the
      coach stopt in St. Martin's Street, and the house and the
      carriage door were opened for their separation! He then suddenly
      and expressively looked at her, abruptly grasped her hand, and,
      with an air of affection, though in a low, husky voice, murmured
      rather than said: 'Good morning, dear lady!' but turned his head
      quickly away, to avoid any species of answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was deeply touched by so gentle an acquiescence in her
      declining the confidential discourse upon which he had
      indubitably meant to open, relative to this mysterious
      alienation. But she had the comfort to be satisfied, that he saw
      and believed in her sincere participation in his feelings; while
      he allowed for the grateful attachment that bound her to a friend
      so loved; who, to her at least, still manifested a fervour of
      regard that resisted all change; alike from this new partiality,
      and from the undisguised, and even strenuous opposition of the
      Memorialist to its indulgence."

      The Memoirs of Dr. Burney, by his daughter, published in 1832,
      together with her Diary and Letters, supplied the materials of
      Lord Macaulay's celebrated article on Madame D'Arblay in the
      "Edinburgh Review" for January, 1843, since reprinted amongst his
      Essays. He describes the Memoirs as a book "which it is
      impossible to read without a sensation made up of mirth, shame,

        than forty years after the occurrence of the scenes I have
        quoted from them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The passages I have quoted amply establish the justice of this
      comparison, for they are utterly irreconcileable with the
      unvarnished statements of the Diary; from which we learn that
      "Cecilia" was published about the beginning of June, when Johnson
      was absent from Streatham; that the Diarist had left Streatham
      prior to August 12th, and did not return to it again that year.
      How could she have passed many months there after she was
      entrusted with the great secret, which (as stated in "Thraliana")
      she only guessed in September or October?
    </p>
    <p>
      How again could Johnson have attributed Mrs. Thrale's conduct to
      caprices "partly wealthy," when he knew that one main source of
      her troubles was pecuniary; or how can his alleged sense of
      ill-treatment be reconciled with his own letters? That he groaned
      over the terrible disturbance of his habits involved in the
      abandonment of Streatham, is likely enough; but as the only words
      he uttered were, "That house is lost to <i>me</i> for ever," and
      "Good morning, dear lady," the accompanying look is about as safe
      a foundation for a theory <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg186"
      id="pg186">186</a></span> of conduct or feeling as Lord
      Burleigh's famous nod in "The Critic." The philosopher was at
      this very time an inmate of Streatham, and probably returned that
      same evening to register a sample of its hospitality. At all
      events, we know that, spite of hints and warnings, sighs and
      groans, he stuck to Streatham to the last; and finally left it
      with Mrs. Thrale, as a member of her family, to reside in her
      house at Brighton, as her guest, for six weeks.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> To talk of conscious ill-treatment or wounded
      dignity, in the teeth of facts like these, is laughable.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] The Edinburgh reviewer says, "Johnson went in Oct. 1782
        from Streatham to Brighton, where he lived a kind of
        boarding-house life;" and adds, "he was not asked out into
        company with his fellow-lodgers." The Thrales had a handsome
        furnished house at Brighton, which is mentioned both in the
        Correspondence and Autobiography.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is amusing enough to watch these attempts to shade away the
        ruinous effect of the Brighton trip on Lord Macaulay's
        Streatham pathos.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay joined the party as Mrs. Thrale's guest on the
      26th October, and on the 28th she writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "At dinner, we had Dr. Delap and Mr. Selwyn, who accompanied us
      in the evening to a ball; as did also Dr. Johnson, to the
      universal amazement of all who saw him there:&mdash;but he said
      he had found it so dull being quite alone the preceding evening,
      that he determined upon going with us: 'for,' he said, 'it cannot
      be worse than being alone.' Strange that he should think so! I am
      sure I am not of his mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th, she records that Johnson behaved very rudely to Mr.
      Pepys, and fairly drove him from the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg187" id="pg187">187</a></span> house. The
      entry for November 10th is remarkable:&mdash;"We spent this
      evening at Lady De Ferrars, where Dr. Johnson accompanied us, for
      the first time he has been invited of our parties since my
      arrival." On the 20th November, she tells us that Mrs. and the
      three Miss Thrales and herself got up early to bathe. "We then
      returned home, and dressed by candle-light, and, <i>as soon as we
      could get Dr. Johnson ready</i>, we set out upon our journey in a
      coach and a chaise, and arrived in Argyll Street at dinner time.
      Mrs. Thrale has there fixed her tent for this short winter, which
      will end with the beginning of April, when her foreign journey
      takes place."

      One incident of this Brighton trip is mentioned in the
      "Anecdotes":
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had got a little French print among us at Brighthelmstone, in
      November 1782, of some people skaiting, with these lines written
      under:

      Madame D'Arblay's Diary describes the outward and visible state
      of things at Brighton. "Thraliana" lays bare the internal
      history, the struggles of the understanding and the heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Brighthelmstone, whither I went when I left Streatham, 7th
      October 1782, I heard this comical epigram about the Irish
      Volunteers:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'There's not one of us all, my brave boys, but would rather

      <p>
        Do ought than offend great King George our good father;
      </p>

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "I had looked ill, or perhaps appeared to feel so much, that my
      eldest daughter would, out of tenderness perhaps, force me to an
      explanation. I could, however, have evaded it if I would; but my
      heart was bursting, and partly from instinctive desire of
      unloading it&mdash;partly, I hope, from principle, too&mdash;I
      called her into my room and fairly told her the truth; told her
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg189" id=
      "pg189">189</a></span> strength of my passion for Piozzi, the
      impracticability of my living without him, the opinion I had of
      his merit, and the resolution I had taken to marry him. Of all
      this she could not have been ignorant before. I confessed my
      attachment to him and her together with many tears and agonies
      one day at Streatham; told them both that I wished I had two
      hearts for their sakes, but having only one I would break it
      between them, and give them each <i>ciascheduno la metà!</i>
      After that conversation she consented to go abroad with me, and
      even appointed the place (Lyons), to which Piozzi meant to follow
      us. He and she talked long together on the subject; yet her never
      mentioning it again made me fear she was not fully apprized of my
      intent, and though her concurrence might have been more easily
      obtained when left only to my influence in a distant country,
      where she would have had no friend to support her different
      opinion&mdash;yet I scorned to take such mean advantage, and told
      her my story <i>now</i>, with the winter before her in which to
      take her measures&mdash;her guardians at hand&mdash;all
      displeased at the journey: and to console her private distress I
      called into the room to her my own bosom friend, my beloved Fanny
      Burney, whose interest as well as judgment goes all against my
      marriage; whose skill in life and manners is superior to that of
      any man or woman in this age or nation; whose knowledge of the
      world, ingenuity of expedient, delicacy of conduct, and zeal in
      the cause, will make her a counsellor invaluable, and leave me
      destitute of every comfort, of every hope, of every expectation.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg190" id="pg190">190</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such are the hands to which I have cruelly committed thy
      cause&mdash;my honourable, ardent, artless Piozzi!! Yet I should
      not deserve the union I desire with the most disinterested of all
      human hearts, had I behaved with less generosity, or endeavoured
      to gain by cunning what is withheld by prejudice. Had I set my
      heart upon a scoundrel, I might have done virtuously to break it
      and get loose; but the man I love, I love for his honesty, for
      his tenderness of heart, his dignity of mind, his piety to God,
      his duty to his mother, and his delicacy to me. In being united
      to this man only can I be happy in this world, and short will be
      my stay in it, if it is not passed with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Brighthelmstone, 16th November 1782</i>.&mdash;For him I have
      been contented to reverse the laws of nature, and request of my
      child that concurrence which, at my age and a widow, I am not
      required either by divine or human institutions to ask even of a
      parent. The life I gave her she may now more than repay, only by
      agreeing to what she will with difficulty prevent; and which, if
      she does prevent, will give her lasting remorse; for those who
      stab <i>me</i> shall hear me groan: whereas if she will&mdash;but
      how can she?&mdash;gracefully or even compassionately consent; if
      she will go abroad with me upon the chance of his death or mine
      preventing our union, and live with me till she is of age&mdash;
      ... perhaps there is no heart so callous by avarice, no soul so
      poisoned by prejudice, no head so feather'd by foppery, that will
      forbear to excuse her when she returns to the rich and the
      gay&mdash;for having saved the life of a <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg191" id="pg191">191</a></span> mother thro'
      compliance, extorted by anguish, contrary to the received
      opinions of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Brighthelmstone, 19th November, 1782</i>.&mdash;What is above
      written, though intended only to unload my heart by writing it, I
      shewed in a transport of passion to Queeney and to Burney. Sweet
      Fanny Burney cried herself half blind over it; said there was no
      resisting such pathetic eloquence, and that, if she was the
      daughter instead of the friend, she should be tempted to attend
      me to the altar; but that, while she possessed her reason,
      nothing should seduce her to approve what reason itself would
      condemn: that children, religion, situation, country, and
      character&mdash;besides the diminution of fortune by the certain
      loss of 800<i>l.</i> a year, were too much to sacrifice for any
      <i>one man</i>. If, however, I were resolved to make the
      sacrifice, <i>a la bonne heure!</i> it was an astonishing proof
      of an attachment very difficult for mortal man to repay."

      What comes next was written in London:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Nov. 27, 1782</i>.&mdash;I have given my Piozzi some
      hopes&mdash;dear, generous, prudent, noble-minded creature; he
      will hardly permit himself to believe it ever can
      be&mdash;<i>come quei promessi miracoli</i>, says he, <i>che non
      vengono mai</i>. For rectitude of mind and native dignity of soul
      I never saw his fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dec. 1, 1782</i>.&mdash;The guardians have met upon the
      scheme of putting our girls in Chancery. I was frighted at the
      project, not doubting but the Lord Chancellor would stop us from
      leaving England, as he would certainly <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg192" id="pg192">192</a></span> see no joke
      in three young heiresses, his wards, quitting the kingdom to
      frisk away with their mother into Italy: besides that I believe
      Mr. Crutchley proposed it merely for a stumbling-block to my
      journey, as he cannot bear to have Hester out of his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody much applauded my resolution in going, but Johnson and
      Cator said they would not concur in stopping me by violence, and
      Crutchley was forced to content himself with intending to put the
      ladies under legal protection as soon as we should be across the
      sea. This measure I much applaud, for if I die or marry in Italy
      their fortunes will be safer in Chancery than any how else.
      Cator<span class="fnref">[1]</span> said <i>I</i> had a right to
      say that going to Italy would benefit the children as much as
      <i>they</i> had to say it would <i>not</i>; but I replied that as
      I really did not mean anything but my own private gratification
      by the voyage, nothing should make me say I meant <i>their</i>
      good by it; and that it would be like saying I eat roast beef to
      mend my daughters' complexions. The result of all is that we
      certainly <i>do go</i>. I will pick up what knowledge and
      pleasure I can here this winter to divert myself, and perhaps my
      <i>compagno fidele</i> in distant climes and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg193" id="pg193">193</a></span> future times,
      with the recollection of England and its inhabitants, all which I
      shall be happy and content to leave <i>for him</i>."

      <p>
        [1] <i>Note by Mrs. T.:</i> "Cator said likewise that the
        attorney's bill ought to be paid by the ladies as a bill of Mr.
        Thrale's, but I replied that perhaps I might marry and give my
        estate away, and if so it would be unjust that they should pay
        the bill which related to that estate only. Besides, if I
        should leave it to Hester, says I, ... why should Susan and
        Sophy and Cecilia and Harriet pay the lawyer's bill for their
        sister's land? He agreed to this plea, and I will live on bread
        and water, but I will pay Norris myself. 'Tis but being a

      Madame D'Arblay writes, Friday, December 27th, 1782:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dined with Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson, who was very comic and
      good-humoured.... Mrs. Thrale, who was to have gone with me to
      Mrs. Orde's, gave up her visit in order to stay with Dr. Johnson.
      Miss Thrale, therefore, and I went together."
    </p>
    <p>
      I return to "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>January</i>, 1783.&mdash;A fit of jealousy seized me the
      other day: some viper had stung me up to a notion that my Piozzi
      was fond of a Miss Chanon. I call'd him gently to account, and
      after contenting myself with slight excuses, told him that,
      whenever we married, I should, however, desire to see as little
      as possible of the lady <i>chez nous</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a large gap in "Thraliana" just in the most interesting
      part of the story of her parting with Piozzi in 1783, and his
      recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>January 29, 1783</i>.&mdash;Adieu to all that's dear, to all
      that's lovely; I am parted from my life, my soul, my Piozzi. If I
      can get health and strength to write my story here, 'tis all I
      wish for now&mdash;oh misery! [Here are four pages missing.] The
      cold dislike of my eldest daughter I thought might wear away by
      familiarity with his merit, and that we might live tolerably
      together, or, at least, part friends&mdash;but no; her aversion
      increased daily, and she communicated it to the others;
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg194" id="pg194">194</a></span>
      they treated <i>me</i> insolently, and <i>him</i> very
      strangely&mdash;running away whenever he came as if they saw a
      serpent&mdash;and plotting with their governess&mdash;a cunning
      Italian&mdash;how to invent lyes to make me hate him, and twenty
      such narrow tricks. By these means the notion of my partiality
      took air, and whether Miss Thrale sent him word slily or not I
      cannot tell, but on the 25th January, 1783, Mr. Crutchley came
      hither to conjure me not to go to Italy; he had heard such
      things, he said, and by <i>means</i> next to <i>miraculous</i>.
      The next day, Sunday, 26th, Fanny Burney came, said I must marry
      him instantly or give him up; that my reputation would be lost
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I actually groaned with anguish, threw myself on the bed in an
      agony which my fair daughter beheld with frigid indifference. She
      had indeed never by one tender word endeavoured to dissuade me
      from the match, but said, coldly, that if I <i>would</i> abandon
      my children I <i>must</i>; that their father had not deserved
      such treatment from me; that I should be punished by Piozzi's
      neglect, for that she knew he hated me; and that I turned out my
      offspring to chance for his sake, like puppies in a pond to swim
      or drown according as Providence pleased; that for her part she
      must look herself out a place like the other servants, for my
      face would she never see more.' 'Nor write to me?' said I. 'I
      shall not, madam,' replied she with a cold sneer, 'easily find
      out your address; for you are going you know not whither, I
      believe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Susan and Sophy said nothing at all, but they taught
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg195" id="pg195">195</a></span>
      the two young ones to cry 'Where are you going, mama? will you
      leave us and die as our poor papa did?' There was no standing
      <i>that</i>., so I wrote my lover word that my mind was all
      distraction, and bid him come to me the next morning, 27th
      January&mdash;my birthday&mdash;and spent the Sunday night in
      torture not to be described. My falsehood to my Piozzi, my strong
      affection for him, the incapacity I felt in myself to resign the
      man I so adored, the hopes I had so cherished, inclined me
      strongly to set them all at defiance, and go with him to church
      to sanctify the promises I had so often made him; while the idea
      of abandoning the children of my first husband, who left me so
      nobly provided for, and who depended on my attachment to his
      offspring, awakened the voice of conscience, and threw me on my
      knees to pray for <i>His</i> direction who was hereafter to judge
      my conduct. His grace illuminated me, His power strengthened me,
      and I flew to my daughter's bed in the morning and told her my
      resolution to resign my own, my dear, my favourite purpose, and
      to prefer my children's interest to my love. She questioned my
      ability to make the sacrifice; said one word from him would undo
      all my&mdash;[Here two pages are missing].

      "I told Dr. Johnson and Mr. Crutchley three days ago that I had
      determined&mdash;seeing them so averse to it&mdash;that I would
      not go abroad, but that, if I did not leave England, I
      <i>would</i> leave London, where I had not been treated to my
      mind, and where I had flung away much unnecessary money with
      little satisfaction; that I was greatly in debt, and somewhat
      like distress'd: that borrowing <span class="pagenum"><a name=

      children worst: that Mr. Crutchley's objection to their lending
      me their money when I had a mortgage to offer as security, was
      unkind and harsh: that I would go live in a little way at Bath
      till I had paid all my debts and cleared my income: that I would
      no more be tyrannized over by people who hated or people who
      plundered me, in short that I would retire and save my money and
      lead this uncomfortable life no longer. They made little or no
      reply, and I am resolved to do as I declared. I will draw in my
      expenses, lay by every shilling I can to pay off debts and
      mortgages, and perhaps&mdash;who knows? I may in six or seven
      years be freed from all incumbrances, and carry a clear income of
      2500<i>l.</i> a year and an estate of 500<i>l.</i> in land to the
      man of my heart. May I but live to discharge my obligations to
      those who <i>hate me</i>; it will be paradise to discharge them
      to him who <i>loves me</i>."

      "<i>April, 1783</i>.&mdash;I will go to Bath: nor health, nor

      not, I suppose, much delight in this scheme [viz, retrenchment of
      expenses and removal to Bath], but why should I lead a life of
      delighting her, who would not lose a shilling of interest or an
      ounce of pleasure to save my life from perishing? When I was near
      losing my existence from the contentions of my mind, and was
      seized with a temporary delirium in Argyll Street, she and her
      two eldest sisters laughed at my distress, and observed to dear
      Fanny Burney, that it was <i>monstrous droll</i>. <i>She</i>
      could hardly suppress her indignation. <span class=

      "Piozzi was ill.... A sore throat, Pepys said it was, with four
      ulcers in it: the people about me said it had been lanced, and I
      mentioned it slightly before the girls.' Has he cut his own
      throat?' says Miss Thrale in her quiet manner. This was less
      inexcusable because she hated him, and the other was her sister;
      though, had she exerted the good sense I thought her possessed
      of, she would not have treated him so: had she adored, and
      fondled, and respected him as he deserved from her hands, and
      from the heroic conduct he shewed in January when he gave into
      her hands, that dismal day, all my letters containing promises of
      marriage, protestations of love, &amp;c., who knows but she might
      have kept us separated? But never did she once caress or thank
      me, never treat him with common civility, except on the very day
      which gave her hopes of our final parting. Worth while to be sure
      it was, to break one's heart for her! The other two are, however,
      neither wiser nor kinder; all swear by her I believe, and follow
      her footsteps exactly. Mr. Thrale had not much heart, but his
      fair daughters have none at all."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      Johnson was not called in to counsel on these matters of the
      heart, but he was not cast off or neglected. Madame D'Arblay
      lands him in Argyll Street on the 20th November, 1782. We hear of
      him at Mrs. Thrale's house or in her company repeatedly from
      Madame D'Arblay and Dr. Lort. "Johnson," writes Dr. Lort, January
      28th, 1783, "is much better. I <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg198" id="pg198">198</a></span> saw him the other evening at
      Madame Thrale's in very good spirits." Boswell says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Friday, March 21, (1783) having arrived in London the night
      before, I was glad to find him at Mrs. Thrale's house, in Argyle
      Street, appearances of friendship between them being still kept
      up. I was shown into his room; and after the first salutation he
      said, 'I am glad you are come; I am very ill'....
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sent a message to acquaint Mrs. Thrale that I was arrived. I
      had not seen her since her husband's death. She soon appeared,
      and favoured me with an invitation to stay to dinner, which I
      accepted. There was no other company but herself and three of her
      daughters, Dr. Johnson, and I. She too said she was very glad I
      was come; for she was going to Bath, and should have been sorry
      to leave Dr. Johnson before I came. This seemed to be attentive
      and kind; and I, <i>who had not been informed of any change,
      imagined all to be as well as formerly</i>. He was little
      inclined to talk at dinner, and went to sleep after it; but when
      he joined us in the drawing-room he seemed revived, and was again
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is quite decisive so far as Boswell is concerned, and
      disposes at once of all his preceding insinuations to her
      disadvantage. He had not seen her before since Thrale's death;
      and now, finding them together and jealously scrutinising their
      tone and manner towards each, he imagined all to be as well as
      formerly.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> That <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg199" id="pg199">199</a></span> they were on
      the point of living apart, and of keeping up their habitual
      interchange of mind exclusively by letters, is no proof that
      either was capriciously or irrecoverably estranged.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "Now on March 21, 1783, fifteen months before the marriage
        in question, Boswell speaks of the severance of the old
        friendship as effected: 'appearances of friendship,' he says,
        'were still maintained between them.' Boswell was at feud with
        the lady when he wrote, as we all know. But his evidence is
        surely sufficient as to the fact of the rupture, though not as
        to its causes."&mdash;<i>(Edin. Rev.</i> p. 510.) Boswell's
        concluding evidence, that to the best of his knowledge and
        observation, there was no change or rupture, is suppressed!
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The pleasures of intimacy in friendship depend far more on
      external circumstances than people of a sentimental turn of mind
      are willing to concede; and when constant companionship ceases to
      suit the convenience of both parties, the chances are that it
      will be dropped on the first favourable opportunity. Admiration,
      esteem, or affection may continue to be felt for one whom, from
      altered habits or new ties, we can no longer receive as an inmate
      or an established member of the family. Johnson was now in his
      seventy-fourth year, haunted by the fear of death, and fond of
      dwelling nauseously on his ailments and proposed remedies. From
      what passed at Brighton, it would seem that there were moods in
      which he was positively unbearable, and could not be received in
      a house without driving every one else out of it. In a roomy
      mansion like Streatham he might be endured, because he could be
      kept out of the way; but in an ordinary town-house or small
      establishment, such a guest would resemble an elephant in a
      private menagerie. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg200" id=
      "pg200">200</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a very great difference, when arrangements are to
      be made for the domestication of a male visitor, between a family
      with a male head, and one consisting exclusively of females. Let
      any widow with daughters make the case her own, and imagine
      herself domesticated in Argyll or Harley Street with the
      lexicographer. The manly authority of Thrale was required to keep
      Johnson in order quite as much as to steady the imputed
      flightiness of the lady; and his idolaters must really remember
      that she was a sentient being, with feelings and affections which
      she was fully entitled to consult in arranging her scheme of
      life. When Lord Macaulay and his school tacitly assume that these
      are to weigh as dust in the balance against the claims of
      learning, they argue like sundry upholders of the temporal
      sovereignty of the Pope, who contend that his subjects should
      complacently endure any amount of oppression rather than endanger
      (what they deem) the vital interests of the Church. When it is
      maintained that the discomfort was amply repaid by the glory he
      conferred, we are reminded of what the Strasbourg goose undergoes
      for fame: "Crammed with food, deprived of drink, and fixed near a
      great fire, before which it is nailed with its feet upon a plank,
      this goose passes, it must be owned, an uncomfortable life. The
      torment would indeed be intolerable, if the idea of the lot which
      awaits him did not serve as a consolation. But when he reflects
      that his liver, bigger than himself, loaded with truffles, and
      clothed in a scientific <i>patè</i>, will, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg201" id="pg201">201</a></span> through the
      instrumentality of M. Corcellet, diffuse all over Europe the
      glory of his name, he resigns himself to his destiny, and suffers
      not a tear to flow."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      Her case for a separation <i>de corps</i> is thus stated in the

    <p>
      "All these exactnesses in a man who was nothing less than exact
      himself, made him extremely impracticable as an inmate, though
      most instructive as a companion, and useful as a friend. Mr.
      Thrale too could sometimes overrule his rigidity, by saying
      coldly, 'There, there, now we have had enough for one lecture,
      Dr. Johnson, we will not be upon education any more till after
      dinner, if you please,'&mdash;or some such speech; but when there
      was nobody to restrain his dislikes, it was extremely difficult
      to find any body with whom he could converse, without living
      always on the verge of a quarrel, or of something too like a
      quarrel to be pleasing. I came into the room, for example, one
      evening, where he and a gentleman, whose abilities we all
      respected exceedingly, were sitting; a lady who had walked in two
      minutes before me had blown 'em both into a flame, by whispering
      something to Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;d, which he endeavoured to
      explain away, so as not to affront the Doctor, whose suspicions
      were all alive. 'And have a care, Sir,' said he, just as I came
      in; 'the old lion will not bear to be tickled.'<span class=

      "Such accidents, however, occurred too often, and I was forced to
      take advantage of my lost lawsuit, and plead inability of purse
      to remain longer in London or its vicinage. I had been crossed in
      my intentions of going abroad, and found it convenient, for every
      reason of health, peace, and pecuniary circumstances, to retire
      to Bath, where I knew Mr. Johnson would not follow me, and where
      I could for that reason command some little portion of time for
      my own use; a thing impossible while I remained at Streatham or
      at London, as my hours, carriage, and servants, had long been at
      his command, who would not rise in the morning till twelve
      o'clock perhaps, and oblige me to make breakfast for him till the
      bell rung for dinner, though much displeased if the toilet was
      neglected, and though much of the time we passed together was
      spent in blaming or deriding, very justly, my neglect of economy,
      and waste of that money which might make many families happy. The
      original reason of our connexion, his <i>particularly disordered
      health and spirits</i><span class="fnref">[2]</span>, had been
      long at an end, and he had no other ailments than old age and
      general infirmity, which every professor of <span class=

      ardently zealous and generally attentive to palliate, and to
      contribute all in their power for the prolongation of a life so
      valuable.

      "Veneration for his virtue, reverence for his talents, delight in
      his conversation, and habitual endurance of a yoke my husband
      first put upon me, and of which he contentedly bore his share for
      sixteen or seventeen years, made me go on so long with Mr.
      Johnson; but the perpetual confinement I will own to have been
      terrifying in the first years of our friendship, and irksome in
      the last, nor could I pretend to support it without help, when my
      coadjutor was no more. To the assistance we gave him, the shelter
      our house afforded to his uneasy fancies, and to the pains we
      took to soothe or repress them, the world perhaps is indebted for
      the three political pamphlets, the new edition and correction of
      his Dictionary, and for the Poets' Lives, which he would scarce
      have lived, I think, and kept his faculties entire, to have
      written, had not incessant care been exerted at the time of his
      first coming to be our constant guest in the country; and several
      times after that, when he found himself particularly oppressed
      with diseases incident to the most vivid and fervent
      imaginations. I shall for ever consider it as the greatest honour
      which could be conferred on any one, to have been the
      confidential friend of Dr. Johnson's health; and to have in some
      measure, with Mr. Thrale's assistance, saved from distress at
      least, if not from worse, a mind great beyond the comprehension
      of common mortals and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg204" id=

      This was written in Italy in 1785, when, painfully alive to the
      insults heaped upon her on Johnson's account, she may be excused
      for dwelling on what she had endured for his sake. But if, as may
      be inferred from her statement, some of the cordiality shewn him
      during the palmy days of their intimacy was forced, this rather
      enhances than lessens the merit of her services, which thus
      become elevated into sacrifices. The question is not how she
      uniformly felt, but how she uniformly behaved to him; and the
      fact of her being obliged to retire to Bath to get out of his way
      proves that there had been no rupture, no coolness, no serious
      offence given or taken on either side, up to April, 1783; just
      one year-and-a-half after the alleged expulsion from Streatham.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were ample avowable reasons for her retirement, and no
      suspicion could have crossed Johnson's mind that he was an
      incumbrance, or he would not have been found at her house by
      Boswell, as he was found on the 21st March, 1783, when she said
      "she was going to Bath, and should have been sorry to leave Dr.
      Johnson before I came." Considering the heart-rending struggle in
      which she was engaged at this time, with the aggravated
      infliction of an unsympathising and dogmatic friend, the wonder
      is how she retained her outward placidity at all.

      In a note on the passage in which he states that Johnson
      studiously avoided all mention of Streatham or the family after
      Thrale's death, Hawkins says:&mdash;"It seems that between him
      and the widow there was a formal taking of leave, for I find in
      his Diary the following note: '1783, April 5th, I took leave of
      Mrs. Thrale. I was much moved. I had some expostulations with
      her. She said she was likewise affected. I commended the Thrales
      with great good will to God; may my petitions have been heard.'"
      This being the day before her parting interview with Piozzi, no
      doubt she was much affected: and as the newspapers had already
      taken up the topic of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg207" id=
      "pg207">207</a></span> her engagement, the expostulations
      probably referred to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preceding commentators were not bound to know what is now learned
      from "Thraliana"; but they were bound to know what might always
      have been learned from Johnson's printed letters; and the tone of
      these from the separation in April, 1783, to the marriage in
      July, 1784, is identically the same as at any period of the
      intimacy which can be specified. There are the same warm
      expressions of regard, the same gratitude for acknowledged
      kindness, the same alternations of hope and disappointment, the
      same medical details, and the same reproaches for silence or
      fancied coldness, in which he habitually indulged towards all his
      female correspondents. Shew me a complaint or reproach, and I
      will instantly match it with one from a period when the intimacy
      was confessedly and notoriously at its height. If her occasional
      explosions of irritability are to be counted, what inference is
      to be drawn from Johnson's depreciatory remarks on her, and
      indeed on everybody, so carefully treasured up by Hawkins and
      Boswell?

      have been put away from me, and my acquaintance hid out of my
      sight.' If the last letter I wrote showed some degree of placid
      acquiescence in a situation, which, however displeasing, is the
      best I can get at just now, I pray God to keep me in that
      disposition, and to lay no more calamity upon me which may again
      tempt me to murmur and complain. <i>In the meantime assure
      yourself of my undiminished kindness and veneration: they have
      been long out of accident's power either to lessen or
      increase."</i>....

      "That <i>you</i> should be solitary is a sad thing, and a strange
      one too, when every body is willing to drop in, and for a quarter
      of an hour at least, save you from a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
      yourself. I never could catch a moment when you were alone whilst
      we were in London, and Miss Thrale says the same thing."

      A few days afterwards, June 19th, he writes:

      which would once have affected you with tenderness <span class=

      but which you will perhaps pass over now with the careless glance
      of frigid indifference. For this diminution of regard, however, I
      know not whether I ought to blame you, who may have reasons which
      I cannot know, and I do not blame myself, who have for a great
      part of human life done you what good I could, and have never

      The Edinburgh reviewer quotes the first paragraph of this letter
      to prove Johnson's consciousness of change on her side, and omits
      all mention of the passages in which he turns to her as "a

      Some time before (November 1782), she had written to him:

      more rigidly for a while, and watch myself carefully; but more
      than six months will I not bestow upon that subject; you shall
      not have in me a valetudinary correspondent, <i>who is always
      writing such letters, that to read the labels tied on bottles by
      an apothecary's boy would be more eligible and amusing</i>; nor
      will I live, like Flavia in 'Law's Serious Call,' who spends half
      her time and money on herself, with sleeping draughts, and waking
      draughts, and cordials and broths. My desire is always to
      determine against my own gratification, so far as shall be
      possible for my body to co-operate with my mind, and you will not
      suspect me of wearing blisters, and living wholly upon vegetables
      for sport. If that will do, the disorder may be removed; but if
      health is gone, and gone for ever, we will act as Zachary Pearce
      the famous bishop of Rochester did, when he lost the wife he
      loved so&mdash;call for one glass to the health of her who is
      departed, never more to return&mdash;and so go quietly back to

      borrowed from them; and in good sense, when they have seen me
      submit my judgment to theirs at the hazard of my life and wits.

      Greek lady phrased it, to teize himself and repent of his sins,

      The date of the following scene, as described by Madame D'Arblay
      in the "Memoirs," is towards the end of November, 1783:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing had yet publicly transpired, with certainty or
      authority, relative to the projects of Mrs. Thrale, who had now
      been nearly a year at Bath<span class="fnref">[1]</span>; though
      nothing was left unreported, or unasserted, with respect to her
      proceedings. Nevertheless, how far Dr. Johnson was himself
      informed, or was ignorant on the subject, neither Dr. Burney nor
      his daughter could tell; and each equally feared to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scarcely an instant, however, was the latter left alone in Bolt
      Court, ere she saw the justice of her long apprehensions;
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg215" id="pg215">215</a></span>
      for while she planned speaking upon some topic that might have a
      chance to catch the attention of the Doctor, a sudden change from
      kind tranquillity to strong austerity took place in his altered
      countenance; and, startled and affrighted, she held her peace....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus passed a few minutes, in which she scarcely dared breathe;
      while the respiration of the Doctor, on the contrary, was of
      asthmatic force and loudness; then, suddenly turning to her, with
      an air of mingled wrath and woe, he hoarsely ejaculated:
      'Piozzi!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He evidently meant to say more; but the effort with which he
      articulated that name robbed him of any voice for amplification,
      and his whole frame grew tremulously convulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His guest, appalled, could not speak; but he soon discerned that
      it was grief from coincidence, not distrust from opposition of
      sentiment, that caused her taciturnity. This perception calmed
      him, and he then exhibited a face 'in sorrow more than anger.'
      His see-sawing abated of its velocity, and, again fixing his
      looks upon the fire, he fell into pensive rumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At length, and with great agitation, he broke forth with: 'She
      cares for no one! You, only&mdash;You, she loves still!&mdash;but
      no one&mdash;and nothing else!&mdash;You she still
      loves&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      "A half smile now, though of no very gay character, softened a
      little the severity of his features, while he tried to resume
      some cheerfulness in adding: 'As ... she loves her little
      finger!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was plain by this burlesque, or, perhaps, playfully
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg216" id="pg216">216</a></span>
      literal comparison, that he meant now, and tried, to dissipate
      the solemnity of his concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hint was taken; his guest started another subject; and this
      he resumed no more. He saw how distressing was the theme to a
      hearer whom he ever wished to please, not distress; and he named
      Mrs. Thrale no more! Common topics took place, till they were
      rejoined by Dr. Burney, whom then, and indeed always, he likewise
      spared upon this subject."

      After quoting this description at length, Lord Brougham remarks:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now Johnson was, perhaps unknown to himself, in love with Mrs.
      Thrale, but for Miss Burney's thoughtless folly there can be no
      excuse. And her father, a person of the very same rank and
      profession with Mr. Piozzi, appears to have adopted the same
      senseless cant, as if it were less lawful to marry an Italian
      musician than an English. To be sure, Miss Burney says, that Mrs.
      Thrale was lineally descended from Adam de Saltsburg, who came
      over with the Conqueror. But assuredly that worthy, unable to
      write his name, would have held Dr. Johnson himself in as much
      contempt as his fortunate rival, and would have regarded his
      alliance as equally disreputable with the Italian's, could his
      consent have been asked."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      If the scene took place at all, it must have taken place within a
      few days after the profession of satisfied and unaltered
      friendship contained in Johnson's letter of November 13th. His
      next letter is to Miss Thrale: <span class="pagenum"><a name=

      and Brocklesby, who neither of them expected he would have
      survived the frost: that being gone, he still remains, and I hope
      will now continue, at least till the next severe one. It has
      indeed carried off a great many old people."

      He was so absorbed with his own complaints as to make no
      allowance for hers. Yet her health was in a very precarious
      state, and in the autumn of the same year, his complaints of
      silence and neglect were suspended by the intelligence that her
      daughter Sophia was lying at death's door. On March 27th, 1784,
      she writes: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg218" id=

      the cause of my complaints. I believe she who lives with me knows
      them no better; one very dreadful one is however removed by dear
      Sophia's recovery. It is kind in you to quarrel no more about
      expressions which were not meant to offend; but unjust to
      suppose, I have not lately thought myself dying. Let us, however,
      take the Prince of Abyssinia's advice, <i>and not add to the
      other evils of life the bitterness of controversy.</i> If courage

      Up to this time she had put an almost killing restraint on her

      perhaps she loved <i>him</i>; perhaps both; yet I have and will

      oh dreadfullest of all days to me I did I send for my Piozzi and
      tell him we must part. The sight of my countenance terrified Dr.
      Pepys, to whom I went into the parlour for a moment, and the
      sight of the agonies I endured in the week following would have
      affected anything but interest, avarice, and pride personified,
      ... with such, however, I had to deal, so my sorrows <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg221" id="pg221">221</a></span> were
      unregarded. Seeing them continue for a whole year, indeed, has
      mollified my strong-hearted companions, and they <i>now</i>
      relent in earnest and wish me happy: I would now therefore be
      <i>loath to dye</i>, yet how shall I recruit my constitution so
      as to live? The pardon certainly did arrive the very instant of
      execution&mdash;for I was ill beyond all power of description,
      when my eldest daughter, bursting into tears, bid me call home
      the man of my heart, and not expire by slow torture in the
      presence of my children, who had my life in their power. 'You are
      dying <i>now</i>,' said she. 'I know it,' replied I, 'and I
      should die in peace had I but seen him <i>once again</i>.' 'Oh
      send for him,' said she, 'send for him quickly!' 'He is at Milan,
      child,' replied I, 'a thousand miles off!' 'Well, well,' returns
      she, 'hurry him back, or I myself will send him an express.' At
      these words I revived, and have been mending ever since. This was
      the first time that any of us had named the name of Piozzi to
      each other since we had put our feet into the coach to come to
      Bath. I had always thought it a point of civility and prudence
      never to mention what could give nothing but offence, and cause
      nothing but disgust, while they desired nothing less than a
      revival of old uneasiness; so we were all silent on the subject,
      and Miss Thrale thought him dead."

      According to the Autobiography, the daughters did not
      conclusively relent till the end of April or the beginning of
      May, when a missive was dispatched for <span class=

      connectedly than I have done of late how I have gone on. The rest
      of that week I devoted almost wholly to sweet Mrs. Thrale, whose
      society was truly the most delightful of cordials to me, however,
      at times mixed with bitters the least palatable.
    </p>

      "One day I dined with Mrs. Grarrick to meet Dr. <span class=

      Carter, Miss Hamilton, and Dr. and Miss Cadogan; and one evening
      I went to Mrs. Vesey, to meet almost everybody,&mdash;the Bishop
      of St. Asaph, and all the Shipleys, Bishop Chester and Mrs.
      Porteous, Mrs. and Miss Ord, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Miss Palmer,
      Mrs. Buller, all the Burrows, Mr. Walpole, Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs.
      Grarrick, and Miss More, and some others. But all the rest of my
      time I gave wholly to dear Mrs. Thrale, who lodged in Mortimer
      Street, and who saw nobody else. Were I not sensible of her
      goodness, and full of incurable affection for her, should I not
      be a monster?

    </p>
    <p>
      The excursion is thus mentioned in "Thraliana": "<i>28th May</i>,
      1784.&mdash;Here is the most sudden and beautiful spring ever
      seen after a dismal winter: so may God grant me a renovation of
      comfort after my many and sharp afflictions. I have been to
      London for a week to visit Fanny Burney, and to talk over my
      intended (and I hope approaching) nuptials, with Mr. Borghi: a
      man, as far as I can judge in so short an acquaintance with him,
      of good sense and real honour:&mdash;who loves my Piozzi,
      <i>likes</i> my conversation, and wishes to serve us sincerely.
      He has recommended Duane to take my power of attorney, and
      Cator's loss will be the less felt. Duane's name is as high as
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg224" id=
      "pg224">224</a></span> Monument, and his being known familiarly
      to Borghi will perhaps quicken his attention to our concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Burney, who loves me <i>kindly</i> but the world
      <i>reverentially</i>, was, I believe, equally pained as delighted
      with my visit: ashamed to be seen in my company, much of her
      fondness for me must of course be diminished; yet she had not
      chatted freely so long with anybody but Mrs. Philips, that my
      coming was a comfort to her. We have told all to her father, and
      he behaved with the utmost propriety.

      "Nobody likes my settling at Milan except myself and Piozzi; but
      I think 'tis nobody's affair but our own: it seems to me quite

      going straight to Italy all will be avoided."

      live happier at Beckford's.&mdash;My daughters parted with me at
      last prettily enough <i>considering</i> (as the phrase is). We
      shall perhaps be still better friends apart than together.

      yesterday and dined with me; but my spirits were too much
      agitated, my heart was too much dilated. I was too
      <i>painfully</i> happy <i>then</i>; my sensations are more quiet
      to-day, and my felicity less tumultuous."

      happy wife of my lovely faithful Piozzi ... subject of my
      prayers, object of my wishes, my sighs, my reverence, my
      esteem.&mdash;His nerves have been horribly shaken, yet he lives,
      he loves me, and will be mine for ever. He has sworn, in the face
      of God and the whole Christian Church; Catholics, Protestants,
      all are witnesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of her memorandum books she has set down:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were married according to the Romish Church in one of our
      excursions to London, by Mr. Smith, Padre Smit as they called
      him, chaplain to the Spanish Ambassador.... Mr. Morgan tacked us
      together at St. James's, Bath, 25th July, 1784, and on the first
      day I think of September, certainly the first week, we took leave
      of England."
    </p>
    <p>
      When her first engagement with Piozzi became known, the
      newspapers took up the subject, and rang the changes on the
      amorous disposition of the widow, and the adroit cupidity of the
      fortune-hunter. On the announcement of the marriage, they
      recommenced the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg227" id=
      "pg227">227</a></span> attack, and people of our day can hardly
      form a notion of the storm of obloquy that broke upon her, except
      from its traces, which have never been erased. To this hour, we
      may see them in the confirmed prejudices of writers like Mr.
      Croker and Lord Macaulay, who, agreeing in little else, agree in
      denouncing "this miserable <i>més</i>alliance" with one who
      figures in their pages sometimes as a music-master, sometimes as
      a fiddler, never by any accident in his real character of a
      professional singer and musician of established reputation,
      pleasing manners, ample means, and unimpeachable integrity. The
      repugnance of the daughters to the match was reasonable and
      intelligible, but to appreciate the tone taken by her friends, we
      must bear in mind the social position of Italian singers and
      musical performers at the period. "Amusing vagabonds" are the
      epithets by which Lord Byron designates Catalani and Naldi, in
      1809<span class="fnref">[1]</span>; and such is the light in
      which they <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg228" id=
      "pg228">228</a></span> were undoubtedly regarded in 1784. Mario
      would have been treated with the same indiscriminating
      illiberality as Piozzi.

        profession, did not rank much higher in the fine world. (See
        Miss Berry's "England and France," vol. ii. p. 42.) A German
        author, non-noble, had a <i>liaison</i> with a Prussian woman
        of rank. On her husband's death he proposed marriage, and was
        indignantly refused. The lady was conscious of no degradation
        from being his mistress, but would have forfeited both caste
        and self-respect by becoming his wife.

    <p>
      Did those who took the lead in censuring or repudiating Mrs.
      Piozzi, ever attempt to enter into her feelings, or weigh her
      conduct with reference to its tendency to promote her own
      happiness? Could they have done so, had they tried? Rarely can
      any one so identify himself or herself with another as to be sure
      of the soundness of the counsel or the justice of the reproof.
      She was neither impoverishing her children (who had all
      independent fortunes) nor abandoning them. She was setting public
      opinion at defiance, which is commonly a foolish thing to do; but
      what is public opinion to a woman whose heart is breaking, and
      who finds, after a desperate effort, that she is unequal to the
      sacrifice demanded of her? She accepted Piozzi deliberately, with
      full knowledge of his character; and she never repented of her
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Cathcart, whose romantic story is mentioned in "Castle
      Rackrent," was wont to say:&mdash;"I have been married three
      times; the first for money, the second for rank, the third for
      love; and the third was worst of all." Mrs. Piozzi's experience
      would have led to an opposite conclusion. Her love match was a
      singularly happy one; and the consciousness that she had
      transgressed conventional observances or prejudices, not moral
      rules, enabled her to outlive and bear down calumny.<span class=

      In reference to these passages, the Edinburgh reviewer remarks:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can be more reasonable; and we should certainly live in
      a more peaceful (if not more entertaining) world, if nobody in it
      reproved another until he had so far identified himself with the
      culprit as to be sure of the justice of the reproof; perhaps,
      also, if a fiddler were rated higher in society than a duke
      without accomplishments, and a carpenter far higher than either.
      But neither reasoning nor gallantry will alter the case, nor
      prevail over the world's prejudice against unequal marriages, any
      more than its prejudices in favour of birth and fashion. It has
      never been quite established to the satisfaction of the
      philosophic mind, why the rule of society should be that 'as the
      husband, so the wife is,' and why a lady who contracts a marriage
      below her station is looked on with far severer eyes than a
      gentleman <i>qui s'encanaille</i> to the same degree.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg230" id="pg230">230</a></span>
      But these things are so,&mdash;as the next dame of rank and
      fortune, and widow of an M.P., who, rashly relying on Mr.
      Hayward's assertion that the world has grown wiser, espouses a
      foreign 'professional,' will assuredly find to her cost, although
      she may escape the ungenerous public attacks which poor Mrs.
      Piozzi earned by her connexion with literary men."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1784 they hanged for crimes which we should think adequately
      punished by a short imprisonment; as they hooted and libelled for
      transgressions or errors which, whatever their treatment by a
      portion of our society, would certainly not provoke the thunders
      of our press. I think (though I made no assertion of the kind)
      that the world has grown wiser; and the reviewer admits as much
      when he says that his supposititious widow "may escape the
      ungenerous public attacks which poor Mrs. Piozzi earned by her
      connexion with literary men." But where do I recommend unequal
      marriages, or dispute the claims of birth and fashion, or
      maintain that a fiddler should be rated higher than a duke
      without accomplishments, and a carpenter <i>far</i> higher than
      either? All this is utterly beside the purpose; and surely there
      is nothing reprehensible in the suggestion that, before harshly
      reproving another, we should do our best to test the justice of
      the reproof by trying to make the case our own. Goethe proposed
      to extend the self-same rule to criticism. One of his favourite
      canons was that a critic should always endeavour to place himself
      temporarily in the author's point of view. If the reviewer had
      done so, he might <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg231" id=
      "pg231">231</a></span> have avoided several material
      misapprehensions and misstatements, which it is difficult to
      reconcile with the friendly tone of the article or the known
      ability of the writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Envy at Piozzi's good fortune sharpened the animosity of
      assailants like Baretti, and the loss of a pleasant house may
      have had a good deal to do with the sorrowing indignation of her
      set. Her meditated social extinction amongst them might have been
      commemorated in the words of the French epitaph:

      "When my wondering eyes first looked over the letter I received
      last night, my mind instantly dictated a high-spirited
      vindication of the consistency, integrity, and faithfulness of
      the friendship thus abruptly reproached <span class=

      away. But a sleepless night gave me leisure to recollect that you
      were ever as generous as precipitate, and that your own heart
      would do justice to mine, in the cooler judgment of future
      reflection. Committing myself, therefore, to that period, I
      determined simply to assure you, that if my last letter hurt
      either you or Mr. Piozzi, I am no less sorry than surprised; and
      that if it offended you, I sincerely beg your pardon.

      "N.B. To this kind note, F.B. wrote the warmest and most
      affectionate and heartfelt reply; but never received another
      word! And here and thus stopped a correspondence of six years of
      almost unequalled partiality, and fondness on her side; and
      affection, gratitude, admiration, and sincerity on that of F.B.,
      who could only conjecture the cessation to be caused by the
      resentment of Piozzi, when informed of her constant opposition to
      the union."
    </p>
    <p>
      If F.B. thought it wrong, she knew it to be inevitable, and in

      A very distinguished friend, whose masterly works are the result
      of a consummate study of the passions, after dwelling on the
      "impertinence" of the hostility her marriage provoked, writes:
      "She was evidently a very vain woman, but her vanity was
      sensitive, and very much allied to that exactingness of heart
      which gives charm and character to woman. I suspect it was this
      sensitiveness which made her misunderstood by her children." The
      justness of this theory of her conduct is demonstrated by the
      self-communings in "Thraliana;" and she misunderstood them as
      much as they misunderstood her. By her own <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg234" id="pg234">234</a></span> showing she
      had little reason to complain of what they <i>did</i> in the
      matter of the marriage; it was what they said, or rather did not
      say, that irritated her. She yearned for sympathy, which was
      sternly, chillingly, almost insultingly withheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1800, she wrote thus to Dr. Gray: "What a good example have
      you set them (his children)! going to visit dear mama at
      Twickenham&mdash;long may they keep their parents, pretty
      creatures! and long may they have sense to know and feel that no
      love is like parental affection,&mdash;the only good perhaps
      which cannot be flung away."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "We may have many friends in life, but we can only have one
        mother: a discovery, says Gray, which I never made till it was
        too late."&mdash;ROGERS.

      Madame D'Arblay states that her father was not disinclined to
      admit Mrs. Piozzi's right to consult her own notions of happiness
      in the choice of a second husband, had not the paramount duty of
      watching over her unmarried daughters interfered. But they might
      have accompanied her to Italy as was once contemplated; and had
      they done so, they would have seen everything and everybody in it
      under the most favourable auspices. The course chosen for them by
      the eldest was the most perilous of the two submitted for their
      choice. The lady, Miss Nicholson, whom their mother had so
      carefully selected as their companion, soon left them; or
      according to another version was summarily dismissed by Miss
      Thrale (afterwards Viscountess Keith), who <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg235" id="pg235">235</a></span> fortunately
      was endowed with high principle, firmness, and energy. She could
      not take up her abode with either of her guardians, one a
      bachelor under forty, the other the prototype of Briggs, the old
      miser in "Cæcilia." She could not accept Johnson's hospitality in
      Bolt Court, still tenanted by the survivors of his menagerie;
      where, a few months later, she sate by his death-bed and received
      his blessing. She therefore called to her aid an old nurse-maid,
      named Tib, who had been much trusted by her father, and with this
      homely but respectable duenna, she shut herself up in the house
      at Brighton, limited her expenses to her allowance of
      200<i>l.</i> a-year, and resolutely set about the course of study
      which seemed best adapted to absorb attention and prevent her
      thoughts from wandering. Hebrew, Mathematics, Fortification, and
      Perspective have been named to me by one of trusted friends as
      specimens of her acquirements and her pursuits.

        "There's a Divinity that shapes our ends,
      </p>
      <p>
        Rough-hew them how we may."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In that solitary abode at Brighton, and in the companionship of
      Tib, may have been laid the foundation of a character than which
      few, through the changeful scenes of a long and prosperous life,
      have exercised more beneficial influence or inspired more genuine
      esteem. On coming of age, and being put into possession of her
      fortune, she hired a house in London, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg236" id="pg236">236</a></span> and took her
      two eldest sisters to live with her. They had been at school
      whilst she was living at Brighton. The fourth and youngest,
      afterwards Mrs. Mostyn, had accompanied the mother. On the return
      of Mr. and Mrs. Piozzi, Miss Thrale made a point of paying them
      every becoming attention, and Piozzi was frequently dining with
      her. Latterly, she used to speak of him as a very worthy sort of
      man, who was not to blame for marrying a rich and distinguished
      woman who took a fancy to him. The other sisters seem to have
      adopted the same tone; and so far as I can learn, no one of them
      is open to the imputation of filial unkindness, or has suffered
      from maternal neglect in a manner to bear out Dr. Burney's
      forebodings by the result. Occasional expressions of
      querulousness are matters of course in family differences, and
      are seldom totally suppressed by the utmost exertion of good
      feeling and good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's idolised wife was, at the lowest estimate, twenty-one
      years older than himself when he married her; and her sons were
      so disgusted by the connection, that they dropped the
      acquaintance. Yet it never crossed his mind that "Hetty" had as
      much right to please herself as "Tetty." Of the six letters that
      passed between him and Mrs. Piozzi on the subject of the
      marriage, only two (Nos. 1 and 5) have hitherto been made public;
      and the incompleteness of the correspondence has caused the most
      embarrassing confusion in the minds of biographers and editors,
      too prone to act on the maxim that, wherever female reputation is
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg237" id="pg237">237</a></span>
      concerned, we should hope for the best and believe the worst.
      Hawkins, apparently ignorant that she had written to Johnson, to
      announce her intention, says, "He was made uneasy by a report"
      which induced him to write a strong letter of remonstrance, of
      which what he calls an <i>adumbration</i> was published in the
      "Gentleman's Magazine" for December 1784. Mr. Croker, avoiding a
      similar error, says:&mdash;"In the lady's own (part) publication
      of the correspondence, this letter (No. 1) is given as from Mrs.
      Piozzi, and is signed with the initial of her name: Dr. Johnson's
      answer is also addressed to Mrs. Piozzi, and both the letters
      allude to the matter as <i>done</i>; yet it appears by the
      periodical publications of the day, that the marriage did not
      take place until the 25th July. The editor knew not how to
      account for this but by supposing that Mrs. Piozzi, to avoid
      Johnson's importunity, had stated that as done which was only
      <i>settled to be done</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter of fact is made plain by the circular (No. 2) which
      states that "Piozzi is coming back from Italy." He arrived on
      July 1st, after a fourteen months' absence, which proved both his
      loyalty and the sincerity of the struggle in her own heart and
      mind. Her letter (No. 1) as printed, is not signed with the
      initial of her name; and both Dr. Johnson's autograph letters are
      addressed to <i>Mrs. Thrale</i>. But she has occasioned the
      mistake into which so many have fallen, by her mode of heading
      these when she printed the two-volume edition of "Letters" in
      1788. By the kindness of Mr. Salusbury <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg238" id="pg238">238</a></span> I am now
      enabled to print the whole correspondence, with the exception of
      her last letter, which she describes.

      written, that I am forced to desire the conclusion of a
      correspondence which I can bear to continue no longer. The birth
      of my second husband is not meaner than that of my first; his
      sentiments are not meaner; his profession is not meaner, and his
      superiority in what he professes acknowledged by all mankind. It
      is want of fortune, then, that is ignominious; the character of
      the man I have chosen has no other claim to such an epithet. The
      religion to which he has been always a zealous adherent will, I
      hope, teach him to forgive insults he has not deserved; mine
      will, I hope, enable me to bear them at once with dignity and

      must notice a charge built upon it by the reviewer, with the
      respectable aid of the foul-mouthed and malignant Baretti:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This letter is now printed for the first time by Mr. Hayward.
      But he has omitted to notice the light which is thrown on it by
      Baretti's account of the marriage. That account is given in the
      'European Magazine' for 1788. It is very circumstantial, and too
      long to transcribe, but the upshot is this: He says that, in
      order to meet her returning lover, she left Bath with her
      daughters as for a journey to Brighton; quitted them on some
      pretence at Salisbury, and posted off to town, <i>deceiving Dr.
      Johnson, who continued to direct to her at Bath as
      usual</i>.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> 'In London she kept
      herself concealed for some days in my parish, and not very
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg244" id="pg244">244</a></span>
      far distant from my own habitation, ... in Suffolk Street,
      Middlesex Hospital.' 'In a <i>few weeks</i>,' he adds, 'she was
      in a condition personally to resort to Mr. Greenland (her lawyer)
      to settle preliminaries, then returned to Bath with Piozzi, and
      there was married.' Now Baretti was a libeller, <i>and not to be
      believed except upon compulsion</i>; but if he does speak the
      truth, then the date, 'Bath, June 30,' of her circular letter, is
      a mystification; so is the passage in her letter to Johnson of
      July <i>4</i>, about 'sending it by the coach to prevent his
      coming.' Of course she was mortally afraid of the Doctor's
      coming, for if he had come he would have found her flown.
      According to this supposition, she did not return to Bath at all,
      but remained perdue in London, with her lover, during the whole
      'Correspondence.' Is it the true one?
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cannot but suspect that it is, and that the solution of the
      whole of this little domestic mystery is to be found in a passage
      in the 'Autobiographical Memoir,' vol. i. p. 277. There were
      <i>two</i> marriages:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Miss Nicholson went with us to Stonehenge, Wilton, &amp;c.,
      <i>whence I returned to Bath</i> to wait for Piozzi. He was here
      on the eleventh day after he got Dobson's letter. In twenty-six
      more we were married <i>in London</i> by the Spanish ambassador's
      chaplain, and returned hither to be married by Mr. Morgan, of
      Bath, at St. James's Church, July 25, 1784.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now in order to make this account tally with Baretti's we must
      allow for a slight exertion of that talent for 'white lies' on
      the lady's part, of which her <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg245" id="pg245">245</a></span> friends, Johnson included, used
      half playfully and half in earnest to accuse her. And we are
      afraid Baretti's story does appear, on the face of it, the more
      probable of the two. It does seem more likely, since they were to
      be married in London (of which Baretti knew nothing), that she
      met Piozzi secretly in London on his arrival, than that she
      performed the awkward evolutions of returning from Salisbury to
      Bath to wait for him there, then going to London in company with
      him to be married, and then back to Bath to be married over
      again. But if this be so, then the London marriage most likely
      took place almost immediately on the meeting of the enamoured
      couple, and while the 'Correspondence' was going on. In which
      case the words in the 'Memoir' 'in twenty-six days,' &amp;c.,
      were apparently intended, by a little bit of feminine adroitness,
      to appear to apply to this first marriage,&mdash;of the
      suddenness of which she may have been ashamed,&mdash;while they
      really apply to the conclusion of the whole affair by the
      <i>second</i>. Will any one have the Croker-like curiosity to
      inquire whether any record remains of the dates of marriages
      celebrated by the Spanish ambassador's chaplain?"<span class=

      Why Croker-like curiosity? Was there anything censurable in the
      curiosity which led an editor to ascertain whether a novel like
      "Evelina" was written by a girl of eighteen or a woman of
      twenty-six? But Lord Macaulay sneered at the inquiry<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, and his worshippers <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg246" id="pg246">246</a></span> must go on
      sneering like their model&mdash;<i>vitiis imitabile</i>. The
      certificate of the London marriage (now before me) shews that it
      was solemnised on the 23rd July, by a clergyman named Richard
      Smith, in the presence of three attesting witnesses. This, and
      the entries in "Thraliana," prove Baretti's whole story to be
      false. "Now Baretti was a libeller, and not to be believed except
      upon compulsion;" meaning, I suppose, without confirmatory
      evidence strong enough to dispense with his testimony altogether.
      He was notorious for his <i>black</i> lies. Yet he is believed
      eagerly, willingly, upon no compulsion, and without any
      confirmatory evidence at all.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] The following passage is reprinted in the corrected edition
        of Lord Macaulay's Essays:&mdash;"There was no want of low
        minds and bad hearts in the generation which witnessed her
        (Miss Burney's) first appearance. There was the envious Kenrick
        and the savage Wolcot; the asp George Steevens and the polecat
        John Williams. It did not, however, occur to them to search the
        parish register of Lynn, in order that they might be able to
        twit a lady with having concealed her age. That truly
        chivalrous exploit was reserved for a bad writer of our own
        time, whose spite she had provoked by not furnishing him with
        materials for a worthless edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson,
        some sheets of which our readers have doubtless seen round
        parcels of better books." There is reason to believe that the
        entry Mr. Croker copied was that of the baptism of an elder
        sister of the same name who died before the birth of the famous
        Fanny.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The internal evidence of the improbability of the story has
      disappeared in the reviewer's paraphrase. Baretti says that at
      Salisbury "she suddenly declared that a letter she found of great
      importance demanded her immediate presence <i>in London</i>....
      But Johnson did not know the least tittle of this transaction,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg247" id="pg247">247</a></span>
      and he continued to direct his letters to Bath as usual,
      expressing, no doubt, an immense wonder <i>at her pertinacious
      silence</i>." So she told her daughters that she was going to
      London, whilst she deceived Johnson, who was sure to learn the
      truth from them; and he was wondering at her pertinacious silence
      at the very time when he was receiving letters from her, dated
      Bath! Why, having formally announced her determination to marry
      Piozzi, she should not give him the meeting in London if she
      chose, fairly passes my comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the reviewer thinks he is strengthening one point, he is
      palpably weakening another. She would not have been "mortally
      afraid of the Doctor's coming," if she had already thrown him off
      and finally broken with him? That she was afraid, and had reason
      to be so, is quite consistent with my theory, quite inconsistent
      with Lord Macaulay's and the critic's. Johnson's letter (No. 3)
      is that of a coarse man who had always been permitted to lecture
      and dictate with impunity. Her letter (No. 4) is that of a
      sensitive woman, who, for the first time, resents with firmness
      and retorts with dignity. The sentences I have printed in italics
      speak volumes. "Never did I oppose your will, or control your
      wish, nor can your unmitigated severity itself lessen my regard."
      There is a shade of submissiveness in her reply, yet, on
      receiving it, he felt as a falcon might feel if a partridge were
      to shew fight. Nothing short of habitual deference on her part,
      and unrepressed indulgence of temper on <i>his</i>, can account
      for <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg248" id=
      "pg248">248</a></span> or excuse his not writing before this
      unexpected check as he wrote after it. If he had not been
      systematically humoured and flattered, he would have seen at a
      glance that he had "no pretence to resent," and have been ready
      at once to make the best return in his power for "that kindness
      which soothed twenty years of a life radically wretched." She
      wrote him a kind and affectionate farewell; and there (so far as
      we know) ended their correspondence. But in "Thraliana" she sets
      down:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Milan, 27th Nov</i>. 1784.&mdash;I have got Dr. Johnson's
      picture here, and expect Miss Thrale's with impatience. I do love
      them dearly, as ill as they have used me, and always shall. Poor
      Johnson did not <i>mean</i> to use me ill. He only grew upon
      indulgence till patience could endure no further."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter to Mr. S. Lysons from Milan, dated December 7th,
      1784, which proves that she was not frivolously employed, she
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My next letter shall talk of the libraries and botanical
      gardens, and twenty other clever things here. I wish you a
      comfortable Christmas, and a happy beginning of the year 1785. Do
      not neglect Dr. Johnson: you will never see any other mortal so
      wise or so good. I keep his picture in my chamber, and his works
      on my chimney."

    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins states that a letter from Johnson to himself contained
      these words:&mdash;"Poor Thrale! I thought that either her virtue
      or her vice (meaning her love of her children or her pride) would
      have saved her from such a marriage. She is now become a subject
      for her enemies to exult over, and for her friends, if she has
      any left, to forget or pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame D'Arblay gives two accounts of the last interview she ever
      had with Johnson,&mdash;on the 25th November, 1784. In the
      "Diary" she sets down:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had seen Miss T. the day before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'So,' said he, 'did I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I then said, 'Do you ever, Sir, hear, from her mother?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' cried he, 'nor write to her. I drive her quite from my
      mind. If I meet with one of her letters, I burn it
      instantly.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> I have burnt all I can
      find. I never speak of her, and I desire never to hear of her
      name. I drive her, as I said, wholly from my mind.'"
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] If this was true, it is strange that he did not destroy the
        letter (No. 4) which gave him so sudden and mortifying a check.
        Miss Hawkins says in her Memoirs: "It was I who discovered the
        letter. I carried it to my father; he enclosed and sent it to
        her, <i>there never having been any intercourse between
        them</i>." Anything from Hawkins about Streatham and its
        inmates must therefore have been invention or hearsay.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the "Memoirs," describing the same interview, she
      says:&mdash;"We talked then of poor Mrs. Thrale, but only for a
      moment, for I saw him greatly incensed, and with such severity of
      displeasure, that I hastened to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg250" id="pg250">250</a></span> start another subject, and he
      solemnly enjoined me to mention that no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was only eighteen days before he died, and he might be
      excused for being angry at the introduction of any agitating
      topic. It would stain his memory, not hers, to prove that,
      belying his recent professions of tenderness and gratitude, he
      directly or indirectly encouraged her assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was tempted to observe," says the author of "Piozziana," "that
      I thought, as I still do, that Johnson's anger on the event of
      her second marriage was excited by some feeling of
      disappointment; and that I suspected he had formed some hope of
      attaching her to himself. It would be disingenuous on my part to
      attempt to repeat her answer. I forget it; but the impression on
      my mind is that she did not contradict me." Sir James Fellowes'
      marginal note on this passage is: "This was an absurd notion, and
      I can undertake to say it was the last idea that ever entered her
      head; for when I once alluded to the subject, she ridiculed the
      idea: she told me she always felt for Johnson the same respect
      and veneration as for a Pascal."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      Piozzi's letters addressed to a Welsh neighbour:
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Daughter of Sir Watkyn Wynn (the fourth baronet) and
        granddaughter of George Grenville, the Minister. She was
        distinguished by her literary taste and acquirements, as well
        as highly esteemed for the uprightness of her character, the
        excellence of her understanding, and the kindness of her heart.
        Her journals and note-books, carefully kept during a long life
        passed in the best society, are full of interesting anecdotes
        and curious extracts from rare books and manuscripts. They are
        now in the possession of her niece, the Honourable Mrs. Rowley.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "<i>London, March</i>, 1825.&mdash;I have had an opportunity of
      talking to old Sir William Pepys on the subject of his old
      friend, Mrs. Piozzi, and from his conversation am more than ever
      impressed with the idea that she was one of the most inconsistent
      characters that ever existed. Sir William says he never met with
      any human being who possessed the talent of conversation in such
      a degree. I naturally felt anxious to know whether Piozzi could
      in any degree add to this pleasure, and found, as I expected,
      that he could not even understand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her infatuation for him seems perfectly unaccountable. Johnson
      in his rough (I may here call it brutal) manner said to her, 'Why
      Ma'am, he is not only a stupid, ugly dog, but he is an old dog
      too.' Sir William says he really believes that she combated her
      inclination for him as long as possible; so long, that her senses
      would have failed her if she had attempted to resist any longer.
      She was perfectly aware of her degradation. One day, speaking to
      Sir William of some persons whom he had been in the habit of
      meeting continually at Streatham during the lifetime of Mr.
      Thrale, she said, not one of them has taken the smallest notice
      of me ever since: they dropped me before I had <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg253" id="pg253">253</a></span> done anything
      wrong. Piozzi was literally at her elbow when she said this."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reviewer quotes the remark, "She was perfectly aware of her
      degradation," as resting on the personal responsibility of Miss
      Wynn, "who knew her in later life in Wales." The context shews
      that Miss Wynn (who did not know her) was simply repeating the
      impressions of Sir William Pepys, one of the bitterest opponents
      of the marriage, to whom she certainly never said anything
      derogatory to her second husband. The uniform tenor of her
      letters and her conduct shew that she never regarded her second
      marriage as discreditable, and always took a high and
      independent, instead of a subdued or deprecating, tone with her
      alienated friends. A bare statement of the treatment she received
      from them is surely no proof of conscious degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a letter to a Welsh neighbour, near the end of her life, some
      time in 1818, she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Mostyn (her youngest daughter) has written again on the
      road back to Italy, where she likes the Piozzis above all people,
      she says, <i>if they were not so proud of their family</i>. Would
      not that make one laugh two hours before one's own death? But I
      remember when Lady Egremont raised the whole nation's ill will
      here, while the Saxons were wondering how Count Bruhle could
      think of marrying a lady born Miss Carpenter. The Lombards
      doubted in the meantime of my being a gentlewoman by birth,
      because my first husband was a brewer. A pretty world, is it
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg254" id="pg254">254</a></span>
      not? A Ship of Fooles, according to the old poem; and they will
      upset the vessel by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the language of one who wished to apologise for a
      misalliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Piozzi's assumed want of youth and good looks, Johnson's
      knowledge of womankind, to say nothing of his self-love, should
      have prevented him from urging this as an insuperable objection.
      He might have recollected the Roman matron in Juvenal, who
      considers the world well lost for an old and disfigured
      prize-fighter; or he might have quoted Spenser's description of
      one&mdash;

      Madame Campan, speaking of Caroline of Naples, the sister of
      Marie Antoinette, says, she had great reason to complain of the
      insolence of a Spaniard named Las Casas, whom the king, her
      father-in-law, had sent to persuade her to remove M.
      Acton<span class="fnref">[1]</span> from the conduct of affairs
      and from about her person. She had told him, to convince him of
      the nature of her sentiments, that she would have Acton painted
      and sculptured by the most celebrated artists of Italy, and send
      his bust and his portrait to the King of Spain, to prove to him
      that the desire of fixing a man of superior capacity <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg255" id="pg255">255</a></span> could alone
      have induced her to confer the favour he enjoyed. Las Casas had
      dared to reply, that she would be taking useless trouble; that a
      man's ugliness did not always prevent him from pleasing, and that
      the King of Spain had too much experience to be ignorant that the
      caprices of a woman were inexplicable. Johnson may surely be
      allowed credit for as much knowledge of the sex as the King of
      Spain.

        [1] M. Acton, as Madame Campan calls him, was a member of the
        ancient English family of that name. He succeeded to the
        baronetcy in 1791, and was the grandfather of Sir John E.E.
        Dalberg Acton, Bart., M.P., &amp;c.

      Others were simultaneously accusing her of marrying a young man
      to indulge a sensual inclination. The truth is, Piozzi was a few
      months older than herself, and was neither ugly nor disagreeable.
      Madame D'Arblay has been already quoted as to his personal
      appearance, and Miss Seward (October, 1787) writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am become acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Piozzi. Her
      conversation is that bright wine of the intellects which has no
      lees. Dr. Johnson told me truth when he said she had more
      colloquial wit than most of our literary women; it is indeed a
      fountain of perpetual flow. But he did not tell me truth when he
      asserted that Piozzi was an ugly dog, without particular skill in
      his profession. Mr. Piozzi is a handsome man, in middle life,
      with gentle, pleasing, unaffected manners, and with very eminent
      skill in his profession. Though he has not a powerful or
      fine-toned voice, he sings with transcending grace and
      expression. I am charmed with his perfect expression on his
      instrument. Surely the finest sensibilities must vibrate through
      his frame, since they breathe so sweetly through his song."
    </p>
    <p>
      The concluding sentence contains what Partridge <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg256" id="pg256">256</a></span> would call a
      <i>non sequitur</i>, for the finest musical sensibility may
      coexist with the most commonplace qualities. But the lady's
      evidence is clear on the essential point; and another passage
      from her letters may assist us in determining the precise nature
      of Johnson's feelings towards Mrs. Piozzi, and the extent to
      which his later language and conduct regarding her were
      influenced by pique:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love is the great softener of savage dispositions. Johnson had
      always a metaphysic passion for one princess or another: first,
      the rustic Lucy Porter, before he married her nauseous mother;
      next the handsome, but haughty, Molly Aston; next the sublimated,
      methodistic Hill Boothby, who read her bible in Hebrew; and
      lastly, the more charming Mrs. Thrale, with the beauty of the
      first, the learning of the second, and with more worth than a
      bushel of such sinners and such saints. It is ridiculously
      diverting to see the old elephant forsaking his nature before
      these princesses:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'To make them mirth, use all his might, and writhe,
      </p>
      <p>
        His mighty form disporting.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "<i>This last and long-enduring passion for Mrs. Thrale was,
      however, composed perhaps of cupboard love, Platonic love, and
      vanity tickled and gratified, from morn to night, by incessant
      homage</i>. The two first ingredients are certainly oddly
      heterogeneous; but Johnson, in religion and politics, in love and
      in hatred, was composed of such opposite and contradictory
      materials, as never before met in the human mind. This
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg257" id="pg257">257</a></span>
      is the reason why folk are never weary of talking, reading, and
      writing about a man&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'So various that he seem'd to be,

      After quoting the sentence printed in italics, the reviewer says:
      "On this hint Mr. Hayward enlarges, nothing loth." I quoted the
      entire letter without a word of comment, and what is given as my
      "enlarging" is an <i>olla podrida</i> of sentences torn from the
      context in three different and unconnected passages of this
      Introduction. The only one of them which has any bearing on the
      point shews, though garbled, that, in attributing motives, I
      distinguished between Johnson and his set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus laid the ground for fixing on me opinions I had
      nowhere professed, the reviewer asks, "Had Mr. Hayward, when he
      passed such slighting judgment on the motives of the venerable
      sage who awes us still, no fear before his eyes of the anathema
      aimed by Carlyle at Croker for similar disparagement? 'As
      neediness, and greediness, and vain glory are the chief qualities
      of most men, so no man, not even a Johnson, acts, or can think of
      acting, on any other principle. Whatever, therefore, cannot be
      referred to the two former categories, Need and Greed, is without
      scruple ranged under the latter.'"<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      This style of criticism is as loose as it is unjust; for
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg258" id="pg258">258</a></span>
      one main ingredient in Miss Seward's mixture is Platonic love,
      which cannot be referred to either of the three categories. Her
      error lay in not adding a fourth ingredient,&mdash;the admiration
      which Johnson undoubtedly felt for the admitted good qualities of
      Mrs. Thrale. But the lady was nearer the truth than the reviewer,
      when he proceeds in this strain:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take an entirely different view at once of the character and
      the feelings of Johnson. Rude, uncouth, arrogant as he
      was&mdash;spoilt as he was, which is far worse, by flattery and
      toadying and the silly homage of inferior
      worshippers&mdash;selfish as he was in his eagerness for small
      enjoyments and disregard of small attentions&mdash;that which lay
      at the very bottom of his character, that which constitutes the
      great source of his power in life, and connects him after death
      with the hearts of all of us, is his spirit of imaginative
      romance. He was romantic in almost all things&mdash;in politics,
      in religion, in his musings on the supernatural world, in
      friendship for men, and in love for women."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "Such was his fancied 'padrona,' his 'mistress,' his 'Thralia
      dulcis,' a compound of the bright lady of fashion and the ideal
      Urania who rapt his soul into spheres of perfection."
    </p>
    <p>
      Imaginative romance in politics, in religion, and in musings on
      the supernatural world, is here only another term for prejudice,
      intolerance, bigotry, and credulity&mdash;for rabid Toryism, High
      Church doctrines verging on Romanism, and a confirmed belief in
      ghosts. Imaginative <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg259" id=
      "pg259">259</a></span> romance in love and friendship is an
      elevating, softening, and refining influence, which, especially
      when it forms the basis of character, cannot co-exist with
      habitual rudeness, uncouthness, arrogance, love of toadying,
      selfishness, and disregard of what Johnson himself called the
      minor morals. Equally heterogeneous is the "compound of the
      bright lady of fashion and the ideal Urania." A goddess in
      crinoline would be a semi-mundane creature at best; and the image
      unluckily suggests that Johnson was unphilosophically, not to say
      vulgarly, fond of rank, fashion, and their appendages.
    </p>
    <p>
      His imagination, far from being of the richest or highest kind,
      was insufficient for the attainment of dramatic excellence, was
      insufficient even for the nobler parts of criticism. Nor had he
      much to boast of in the way of delicacy of perception or
      sensibility. His strength lay in his understanding; his most
      powerful weapon was argument: his grandest quality was his good
      sense.

      Thurlow, speaking of the choice of a successor to Lord Mansfield,
      said, "I hesitated long between the intemperance of Kenyon, and
      the corruption of Buller; not but what there was a
      d&mdash;&mdash;d deal of corruption in Kenyon's intemperance, and
      a d&mdash;&mdash;d deal of intemperance in Buller's corruption."
      Just so, we may hesitate long between the romance and the
      worldliness of Johnson, not but what there was a d&mdash;&mdash;d
      deal of romance in his worldliness, and a d&mdash;&mdash;d deal
      of worldliness in his romance. <span class="pagenum"><a name=

      The late Lord Alvanley, whose heart was as inflammable as his wit
      was bright, used to tell how a successful rival in the favour of
      a married dame offered to retire from the field for <i>5001</i>.,
      saying, "I am a younger son: her husband does not give dinners,
      and they have no country house: no <i>liaison</i> suits me that
      does not comprise both." At the risk of provoking Mr. Carlyle's
      anathema, I now avow my belief that Johnson was, nay, boasted of
      being, open to similar influences; and as for his "ideal
      Uranias," no man past seventy idealises women with whom he has
      been corresponding for years about his or their "natural
      history," to whom he sends recipes for "lubricity of the bowels,"
      with an assurance that it has had the best effect upon his
      own.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Letters, vol. ii. p. 397. The letter containing the recipe
        actually begins "My dear Angel." Had Johnson forgotten Swift's
        lines on Celia? or the repudiation of the divine nature by
        Ermodotus, which occurs twice in Plutarch? The late Lord
        Melbourne complained that two ladies of quality, sisters, told
        him too much of their "natural history."

      Rough language, too, although not incompatible with affectionate

        "Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love,

      "His ugly old wife," says the reviewer, "was an angel." Yes, an
      angel so far as exalted language could make her one; and he had
      always half-a-dozen angels or goddesses on his list. "<i>Je
      change d'objet, mais la passion reste</i>." For <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg261" id="pg261">261</a></span> this very
      reason, I repeat, his affection for Mrs. Piozzi was not a deep,
      devoted, or absorbing feeling at any time; and the gloom which
      settled upon the evening of his days was owing to his infirmities
      and his dread of death, not to the loosening of cherished ties,
      nor to the compelled solitude of a confined dwelling in Bolt
      Court. The plain matter of fact is that, during the last two
      years of his life, he was seldom a month together at his own
      house, unless when the state of his health prevented him from
      enjoying the hospitality of his friends. When the fatal marriage
      was announced, he was planning what Boswell calls a jaunt into
      the country; and in a letter dated Lichfield, Oct. 4, 1784, he
      says: "I passed the first part of the summer at Oxford (with Dr.
      Adams); afterwards I went to Lichfield, then to Ashbourne (Dr.
      Taylor's), and a week ago I returned to Lichfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the journal which he kept for Dr. Brocklesby, he writes, Oct.
      20: "The town is my element; there are my friends, there are my
      books to which I have not yet bid farewell, and there are my
      amusements. Sir Joshua told me long ago that my vocation was to
      public life; and I hope still to keep my station, till God shall
      bid me <i>Go in peace</i>." Boswell reports him saying about this
      time, "Sir, I look upon every day to be lost when I do not make a
      new acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      After another visit to Dr. Adams, at Pembroke College, he
      returned on the 16th Nov. to London, where he died on the 13th
      Dec. 1784. The proximate cause of his death was dropsy; and there
      is not the smallest <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg262" id=
      "pg262">262</a></span> sign of its having been accelerated or
      embittered by unkindness or neglect.

    <p>
      Whoever has accompanied me thus far will be fully qualified to
      form an independent opinion of Lord Macaulay's dashing summary of
      Mrs. Piozzi's imputed ill-treatment of Johnson:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johnson was now in his seventy-second year. The infirmities of
      age were coming fast upon him. That inevitable event of which he
      never thought without horror was brought near to him; and his
      whole life was darkened by the shadow of death. He had often to
      pay the cruel price of longevity. Every year he lost what could
      never be replaced. The strange dependants to whom he had given
      shelter, and to whom, in spite of their faults, he was strongly
      attached by habit, dropped off one by one; and, in the silence of
      his home, he regretted even the noise of their scolding matches.
      The kind and generous Thrale was no more; and it would have been
      well if his wife had been laid beside him. But she survived to be
      the laughing-stock of those who had envied her, and to draw from
      the eyes of the old man who had loved her beyond any thing in the
      world, tears far more bitter than he would have shed over her
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With some estimable, and many agreeable qualities, she was not
      made to be independent. The control of a mind more steadfast than
      her own was necessary to her respectability. While she was
      restrained by her husband, a man of sense and firmness, indulgent
      to her taste in trifles, but always the undisputed master
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg263" id="pg263">263</a></span>
      of his house, her worst offences had been impertinent jokes,
      white lies, and short fits of pettishness ending in sunny good
      humour. But he was gone; and she was left an opulent widow of
      forty, with strong sensibility, volatile fancy, and slender
      judgment. She soon fell in love with a music-master from Brescia,
      in whom nobody but herself could discover anything to admire. Her
      pride, and perhaps some better feelings, struggled hard against
      this degrading passion. But the struggle irritated her nerves,
      soured her temper, and at length endangered her health. Conscious
      that her choice was one which Johnson could not approve, she
      became desirous to escape from his inspection. Her manner towards
      him changed. She was sometimes cold and sometimes petulant. She
      did not conceal her joy when he left Streatham: she never pressed
      him to return; and, if he came unbidden, she received him in a
      manner which convinced him that he was no longer a welcome guest.
      He took the very intelligible hints which she gave. He read, for
      the last time, a chapter of the Greek Testament in the library
      which had been formed by himself. In a solemn and tender prayer
      he commended the house and its inmates to the Divine protection,
      and, with emotions which choked his voice and convulsed his
      powerful frame, left for ever that beloved home for the gloomy
      and desolate house behind Fleet Street, where the few and evil
      days which still remained to him were to run out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, in June 1783, he had a paralytic stroke, from which,
      however, he recovered, and which does not appear <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg264" id="pg264">264</a></span> to have at
      all impaired his intellectual faculties. But other maladies came
      thick upon him. His asthma tormented him day and night. Dropsical
      symptoms made their appearance. While sinking under a
      complication of diseases, he heard that the woman whose
      friendship had been the chief happiness of sixteen years of his
      life, had married an Italian fiddler; that all London was crying
      shame upon her; and that the newspapers and magazines were filled
      with allusions to the Ephesian matron and the two pictures in
      Hamlet. He vehemently said that he would try to forget her
      existence. He never uttered her name. Every memorial of her which
      met his eye he flung into the fire. She meanwhile fled from the
      laughter and hisses of her countrymen and countrywomen to a land
      where she was unknown, hastened across Mount Cenis, and learned,
      while passing a merry Christmas of concerts and lemonade-parties
      at Milan, that the great man with whose name hers is inseparably
      associated, had ceased to exist."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

      "Splendid recklessness," is the happy expression used by the
      "Saturday Review" in characterising this account of the alleged
      rupture with its consequences; and no reader will fail to admire
      the rhetorical skill with which the expulsion from Streatham with
      its library formed by himself, the chapter in the Greek
      testament, the gloomy and desolate home, the music-master
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg265" id="pg265">265</a></span>
      in whom nobody but herself could see anything to admire, the few
      and evil days, the emotions that convulsed the frame, the painful
      and melancholy death, and the merry Christmas of concerts and
      lemonade parties, have been grouped together with the view of
      giving picturesqueness, impressive unity, and damnatory vigour to
      the sketch. "Action, action, action," says the orator; "effect,
      effect, effect," says the historian. Give Archimedes a place to
      stand on, and he would move the world. Give Fouché a line of a
      man's handwriting, and he would engage to ruin him. Give Lord
      Macaulay the semblance of an authority, an insulated fact or
      phrase, a scrap of a journal, or the tag end of a song, and on
      it, by the abused prerogative of genius, he would construct a
      theory of national or personal character, which should confer
      undying glory or inflict indelible disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was never driven or expelled from Mrs. Piozzi's house or
      family: if very intelligible hints were given, they certainly
      were not taken; the library was not formed by him; the Testament
      may or may not have been Greek; his powerful frame shook with no
      convulsions but what may have been occasioned by the unripe
      grapes and hard peaches; he did not leave Streatham for his
      gloomy and desolate house behind Fleet Street; the few and evil
      days (two years, nine weeks) did not run out in that house; the
      music-master was generally admired and esteemed; and the merry
      Christmas of concerts and lemonade-parties is simply another
      sample of the brilliant historian's mode of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg266" id="pg266">266</a></span> turning the
      abstract into the concrete in such a manner as to degrade or
      elevate at will. An Italian concert is not a merry meeting; and a
      lemonade-party, I presume, is a party where (instead of
      <i>eau-sucrée</i> as at Paris) the refreshment handed about is
      lemonade: not an enlivening drink at Christmas. In a word, all
      these graphic details are mere creations of the brain, and the
      general impression intended to be conveyed by them is false,
      substantially false; for Mrs. Piozzi never behaved otherwise than
      kindly and considerately to Johnson at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her life in Italy has been sketched in her best manner by her own
      lively pen in the "Autobiography" and what she calls the "Travel
      Book," to be presently mentioned. Scattered notices of her
      proceedings occur in her letters to Mr. Lysons, and in the
      printed correspondence of her cotemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 19th October, 1784, she writes to Mr. Lysons from Turin:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going to Alexandria, Genoa, and Pavia, and then to Milan
      for the winter, as Mr. Piozzi finds friends everywhere to delay
      us, and I hate hurry and fatigue; it takes away all one's
      attention. Lyons was a delightful place to me, and we were so
      feasted there by my husband's old acquaintances. The Duke and
      Duchess of Cumberland too paid us a thousand caressing civilities
      where we met with them, and we had no means of musical parties
      neither. The Prince of Sisterna came yesterday to visit Mr.

    <p>
      "<i>3rd November</i>, 1784.&mdash;Yesterday I received a letter
      from Mr. Baretti, full of the most flagrant and bitter insults
      concerning my late marriage with Mr. Piozzi, against whom,
      however, he can bring no heavier charge than that he disputed on
      the road with an innkeeper concerning the bill in his last
      journey to Italy; while he accuses me of murder and fornication
      in the grossest terms, such as I believe have scarcely ever been
      used even to his old companions in Newgate, whence he was
      released to scourge the families which cherished, and bite the
      hands that have since relieved him. Could I recollect any
      provocation I ever gave the man, I should be less amazed, but he
      heard, perhaps, that Johnson had written me a rough letter, and
      thought he would write me a brutal one: like the Jewish king,
      who, trying to imitate Solomon without his understanding, said,
      'My father whipped you with whips, but I will whip you with
      scorpions.'"
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "I correspond constantly and copiously with such of my daughters
      as are willing to answer my letters, and I have at last received
      one cold scrap from the eldest, which I instantly and tenderly
      replied to. Mrs. Lewis too, and Miss Nicholson, have had accounts
      of my health, for I found <i>them</i> disinterested and attached
      to me: those who led the stream, or watched which <span class=

      that they might follow it, were not, I suppose, desirous of my
      correspondence, and till they are so, shall not be troubled with
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Nicholson was the lady left with the daughters, and Mrs.
      Piozzi could have heard no harm of her from them or others when
      she wrote thus. The same inference must be drawn from the
      allusions to this lady at subsequent periods. After stating that
      she "dined at the minister's o' Tuesday, and he called all the
      wise men about me with great politeness indeed"&mdash;"Once
      more," she continues, "keep me out of the newspapers if you
      possibly can: they have given me many a miserable hour, and my
      enemies many a merry one: but I have not deserved public
      persecution, and am very happy to live in a place where one is
      free from unmerited insolence, such as London abounds with.

      any way so as to give them a right to discuss her conduct or
      affairs, not even as an author, made the butt of every

      January 20th, 1785, she writes from Milan:&mdash;"The Minister,

      sufficiently to think what will be the consequence to me of
      Johnson's death, but must wait the event, as all thoughts on the
      future in this world are vain. Six people have already undertaken
      to write his life, I hear, of which Sir John Hawkins, Mr.
      Boswell, Tom Davies, and Dr. Kippis are four. Piozzi says he
      would have me add to the number, and so I would, but that I think
      my anecdotes too few, and am afraid of saucy answers if I send to
      England for others. The saucy answers <i>I</i> should

      laboured so long to keep secret; and I was so very delicate <i>in
      trying to conceal his [fancied]<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
      insanity</i> that I retained no proofs of it, or hardly any, nor
      even mentioned it in these books, lest by my dying first
      <i>they</i> might be printed and the secret (for such I thought
      it) discovered. I used to tell him in jest that his biographers
      would be at a loss concerning some orange-peel he used to keep in
      his pocket, and many a joke we had about the lives that would be
      published. Rescue me out of their hands, my dear, and do it
      yourself, said he; Taylor, Adams, and Hector will furnish you
      with juvenile anecdotes, and Baretti will give you all the rest
      that you have not already, for I think Baretti is a lyar only
      when he speaks of himself. Oh, said I, Baretti told me yesterday
      that you got by heart six pages of Machiavel's History once, and
      repeated them thirty years afterwards word for word. Why this is
      a <i>gross</i> lye, said Johnson, I never read the book at all.
      Baretti too told me of you (said I) that you once kept sixteen
      cats in your chamber, and yet they scratched your legs to such a
      degree, you were forced to use mercurial plaisters for some time
      after. Why this (replied Johnson) is an unprovoked lye indeed; I
      thought the fellow would not have broken through divine and human
      laws thus to make puss his heroine, but I see I was mistaken."

      On February 3rd, 1785, Horace Walpole writes from London to Sir
      Horace Mann at Florence:&mdash;"I have lately been lent a volume
      of poems composed and printed at Florence, in which another of
      our exheroines, Mrs. Piozzi, has a considerable share; her
      associates three of the English bards who assisted in the little
      garland which Ramsay the painter sent me. The present is a plump
      octavo; and if you have not sent me a copy by our nephew, I
      should be glad if you could get one for me: not for the merit of
      the verses, which are moderate enough and faint imitations of our
      good poets; but for a short and sensible and genteel preface by
      La Piozzi, from whom I have just seen a very clever letter to
      Mrs. Montagu, to disavow a jackanapes who has lately made a noise
      here, one Boswell, by Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson. In a day or two
      we expect another collection by the same Signora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her associates were Greathead, Merry, and Parsons. The volume in
      question was "The Florence Miscellany." "A copy," says Mr.
      Lowndes, "having fallen into the hands of W. Grifford, gave rise
      to his admirable satire of the 'Baviad and Moeviad.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In his Journal of the Tour to the Hebrides, Boswell makes Johnson
      say of Mrs. Montagu's "Essay on Shakespeare": "Reynolds is fond
      of her book, and I wonder at it; for neither I, nor Beauclerc,
      nor Mrs. Thrale could get through it." This is what Mrs. Piozzi
      wrote to disavow, so far as she was personally concerned. In a
      subsequent letter from Vienna, she says: "Mrs. Montagu has
      written to me very sweetly." The other collection expected from
      her was her "Anecdotes of the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg272" id="pg272">272</a></span> late Samuel Johnson, during the
      last Twenty Years of his Life. Printed for T. Cadell in the
      Strand, 1786."
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the matter to Mr. Cadell in the following terms:
    </p>
    <p class="quotdate">
      "Florence, 7th June, 1785.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sir</i>.,&mdash;As you were at once the bookseller and friend
      of Dr. Johnson, who always spoke of your character in the kindest
      terms, I could wish you likewise to be the publisher of some
      Anecdotes concerning the last twenty years of his life, collected
      by me during the many days I had opportunity to spend in his
      instructive company, and digested into method since I heard of
      his death. As I have a large collection of his letters in
      England, besides some verses, known only to myself, I wish to
      delay printing till we can make two or three little volumes, not
      unacceptable, perhaps, to the public; but I desire my intention
      to be notified, for divers reasons, and, if you approve of the
      scheme, should wish it to be immediately advertized. My return
      cannot be in less than twelve months, and we may be detained
      still longer, as our intention is to complete the tour of Italy;
      but the book is in forwardness, and it has been seen by many
      English and Italian friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      On July 27th, 1785, she writes from Florence:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We celebrated our wedding anniversary two days ago with a
      magnificent dinner and concert, at which the Prince Corsini and
      his brother the Cardinal did us the honour of assisting, and
      wished us joy in the tenderest and politest terms. Lord and Lady
      Cowper, Lord Pembroke, and <i>all</i> the English indeed, doat on
      my husband, and show us every possible attention." <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg273" id="pg273">273</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 18th July, 1785, she writes again to Mr. Cadell:&mdash;"I
      am favoured with your answer and pleased with the advertisement,
      but it will be impossible to print the verses till my return to
      England, as they are all locked up with other papers in the Bank,
      nor should I choose to put the key (which is now at Milan) in any
      one's hand except my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      She therefore proposes that the "Anecdotes" shall be printed
      first, and published separately. On the 20th October, 1785, she
      writes from Sienna:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I finished my 'Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson' at Florence, and taking
      them with me to Leghorn, got a clear transcript made there, such
      as I hope will do for you to print from; though there may be some
      errors, perhaps many, which have escaped me, as I am wholly
      unused to the business of sending manuscripts to the press, and
      must rely on you to get everything done properly when, it comes
      into your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the surviving ascendency of Johnson, or such the
      placability of her disposition, that, but for Piozzi's
      remonstrances, she would have softened down her "Anecdotes" to an
      extent which would have destroyed much of their sterling value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lysons made the final bargain with Cadell, and had full power
      to act for her. She writes thus to Cadell:
    </p>
    <p class="quotdate">
      "Rome, 28th March, 1786.
    </p>
    <p>
      "SIR,&mdash;I hasten to tell you that I am perfectly pleased and
      contented with the alterations made by my worthy and amiable
      friends in the 'Anecdotes of Johnson's <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg274" id="pg274">274</a></span> Life.'
      Whatever is done by Sir Lucas Pepys is certainly well done, and I
      am happy in the thoughts of his having interested himself about
      it. Mr. Lysons was very judicious and very kind in going to the
      Bishop of Peterboro', and him and Dr. Lort for advice. There is
      no better to be had in the world, I believe; and it is my desire
      that they should be always consulted about any future
      transactions of the same sort relating to, Sir, your most
      obedient servant,
    </p>

    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] The letters to Mr. Cadell were published in the
        "Gentleman's Magazine" for March and April, 1852.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The early portions of "Thraliana" were evidently amongst the
      papers locked up in the Bank, and she consequently wrote most of
      the Anecdotes from memory, which may account for some minor
      discrepancies, like that relating to the year in which she made
      the acquaintance with Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book attracted great attention; and whilst some affected to
      discover in it the latent signs of wounded vanity and pique,
      others vehemently impugned its accuracy. Foremost amongst her
      assailants stood Boswell, who had an obvious motive for
      depreciating her, and he attempts to destroy her authority,
      first, by quoting Johnson's supposed imputations on her veracity;
      and secondly, by individual instances of her alleged departure
      from truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, Johnson is reported to have said:&mdash;"It is amazing,
      Sir, what deviations there are from precise truth, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg275" id="pg275">275</a></span> in the
      account which is given of almost everything. I told Mrs. Thrale,
      You have so little anxiety about truth that you never tax your
      memory with the exact thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her proneness to exaggerated praise especially excited his
      indignation, and he endeavours to make her responsible for his
      rudeness on the strength of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale gave high praise to Mr. Dudley Long (now North).
      <i>Johnson</i>. 'Nay, my dear lady, don't talk so. Mr. Long's
      character is very <i>short</i>. It is nothing. He fills a chair.
      He is a man of genteel appearance, and that is all. I know nobody
      who blasts by praise as you do: for whenever there is exaggerated
      praise, every body is set against a character. They are provoked
      to attack it. Now there is Pepys; you praised that man with such
      disproportion, that I was incited to lessen him, perhaps more
      than he deserves. <i>His blood is upon your head</i>. By the same
      principle, your malice defeats itself; for your censure is too
      violent. And yet (looking to her with a leering smile) she is the
      first woman in the world, could she but restrain that wicked
      tongue of hers;&mdash;she would be the only woman, could she but
      command that little whirligig.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the words I have printed in italics she has written: "An
      expression he would not have used; no, not for worlds."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Boswell's note of a visit to Streatham in 1778, we
      find:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next morning, while we were at breakfast, Johnson gave a very
      earnest recommendation of what he himself <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg276" id="pg276">276</a></span> practised
      with the utmost conscientiousness: I mean a strict attention to
      truth even in the most minute particulars. 'Accustom your
      children,' said he, 'constantly to this: if a thing happened at
      one window, and they, when relating it, say that it happened at
      another, do not let it pass, but instantly check them: you do not
      know where deviation from truth will end.' <i>Boswell</i>. 'It
      may come to the door: and when once an account is at all varied
      in one circumstance, it may by degrees be varied so as to be
      totally different from what really happened.' Our lively hostess,
      whose fancy was impatient of the rein, fidgeted at this, and
      ventured to say 'Nay, this is too much. If Dr. Johnson should
      forbid me to drink tea, I would comply, as I should feel the
      restraint only twice a day: but little variations in narrative
      must happen a thousand times a day, if one is not perpetually
      watching.' <i>Johnson</i>. 'Well, Madam, and you <i>ought</i> to
      be perpetually watching. It is more from carelessness about
      truth, than from intentional lying, that there is so much
      falsehood in the world.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the illustrative incident, which occurred during the same
      visit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had before dinner repeated a ridiculous story told me by an
      old man, who had been a passenger with me in the stage-coach
      to-day. Mrs. Thrale, having taken occasion to allude to it in
      talking to me, called it, 'The story told you by the old
      <i>woman</i>.' 'Now, Madam,' said I, 'give me leave to catch you
      in the fact: it was not an old <i>woman</i>, but an old
      <i>man</i>, whom I mentioned <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg277" id="pg277">277</a></span> as having told me this.' I
      presumed to take an opportunity, in the presence of Johnson, of
      showing this lively lady how ready she was, unintentionally, to
      deviate from exact authenticity of narration."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the margin: "Mrs. Thrale knew there was no such thing as an
      Old Man: when a man gets superannuated, they call him an Old
      Woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The remarks on the value of truth attributed to Johnson are just
      and sound in the main, but when they are pointed against
      character, they must be weighed in reference to the very high
      standard he habitually insisted upon. He would not allow his
      servant to say he was not at home when he was. "A servant's
      strict regard for truth," he continued, "must be weakened by such
      a practice. A philosopher may know that it is merely a form of
      denial; but few servants are such nice distinguishers. If I
      accustom a servant to tell a lie for me, have I not reason to
      apprehend that he will tell many lies for himself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his townspeople, Mr. Wickens, of Lichfield, was walking
      with him in a small meandering shrubbery formed so as to hide the
      termination, and observed that it might be taken for an extensive
      labyrinth, but that it would prove a deception, though it was,
      indeed, not an unpardonable one. "Sir," exclaimed Johnson, "don't
      tell me of deception; a lie, Sir, is a lie, whether it be a lie
      to the eye or a lie to the ear." Whilst he was in one of these
      paradoxical humours, there was no pleasing him; and he has been
      known to insult persons of respectability for repeating current
      accounts of events, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg278" id=
      "pg278">278</a></span> sounding new and strange, which turned out
      to be literally true; such as the red-hot shot at Gibraltar, or
      the effects of the earthquake at Lisbon. Yet he could be lax when
      it suited him, as speaking of epitaphs: "The writer of an epitaph
      should not be considered as saying nothing but what is strictly
      true. Allowance must be made for some degree of exaggerated
      praise. In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath." Is he
      upon oath in narrating an anecdote? or could he do more than
      swear to the best of his recollection and belief, if he was.
      Boswell's notes of conversations are wonderful results of a
      peculiar faculty, or combination of faculties, but the utmost
      they can be supposed to convey is the substance of what took
      place, in an exceedingly condensed shape, lighted up at intervals
      by the <i>ipsissima verba</i>, of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whilst he went on talking triumphantly," says Boswell, "I was
      fixed in admiration, and said to Mrs. Thrale, 'O for short-hand
      to take this down!' 'You'll carry it all in your head,' said she;
      'a long head is as good as short-hand.'" On his boasting of the
      efficiency of his own system of short-hand to Johnson, he was put
      to the test and failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi at once admits and accounts for the inferiority of
      her own collection of anecdotes, when she denounces "a trick
      which I have seen played on common occasions, of sitting steadily
      down at the other end of the room, to write at the moment what
      should be said in company, either <i>by</i> Dr. Johnson or
      <i>to</i> him, I never practised myself, nor approved of in
      another. There <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg279" id=
      "pg279">279</a></span> is something so ill-bred, and so inclining
      to treachery in this conduct, that were it commonly adopted, all
      confidence would soon be exiled from society, and a conversation
      assembly room would become tremendous as a court of justice."
      This is a hit at Boswell, who (as regards Johnson himself) had
      full licence to take notes the best way he could. Madame
      D'Arblay's are much fuller, and bear a suspicious resemblance to
      the dialogues in her novels.
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      In a reply to Boswell, dated December 14th, 1793, Miss Seward
      pointedly remarks:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Johnson's frequently-expressed contempt for Mrs. Thrale on
      account of that want of veracity which he imputes to her, at
      least as Mr. Boswell has recorded, either convicts him of
      narrating what Johnson never said, or Johnson himself of that
      insincerity of which there are too many instances, amidst all the
      recorded proofs of his unprovoked personal rudeness, to those
      with whom he conversed; for, this repeated contempt was coeval
      with his published letters, which express such high and perfect
      esteem for that lady, which declare that 'to hear her, was to
      hear Wisdom, that to see her, was to see Virtue.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Macaulay and his advocate in the "Edinburgh Review," who
      speak of Mrs. Piozzi's "white lies," have not convicted her of
      one; and Mr. Croker bears strong testimony to her accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi prefaces some instances of Johnson's rudeness and
      harshness by the remark, that "he did not hate the persons he
      treated with roughness, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg280"
      id="pg280">280</a></span> despise them whom he drove from him by
      apparent scorn. He really loved and respected many whom he would
      not suffer to love him." Boswell echoes the remark, multiplies
      the instances, and then accuses her of misrepresenting their
      friend. After mentioning a discourteous reply to Robertson the
      historian, which was subsequently confirmed by Boswell, she
      proceeds to show that Johnson was no gentler to herself or those
      for whom he had the greatest regard. "When I one day lamented the
      loss of a first cousin, killed in America, 'Prithee, my dear
      (said he), have done with canting: how would the world be worse
      for it, I may ask, if all your relations were at once spitted
      like larks and roasted for Presto's supper?'&mdash;Presto was the
      dog that lay under the table." To this Boswell opposes the
      version given by Baretti:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Thrale, while supping very heartily upon larks, laid down
      her knife and fork, and abruptly exclaimed, 'O, my dear Johnson!
      do you know what has happened? The last letters from abroad have
      brought us an account that our poor cousin's head was taken off
      by a cannon-ball.' Johnson, who was shocked both at the fact and
      her light unfeeling manner of mentioning it, replied, 'Madam, it
      would give <i>you</i> very little concern if all your relations
      were spitted like those larks, and dressed for Presto's supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      This version, assuming its truth, aggravates the personal
      rudeness of the speech. But her marginal notes on the passage
      are: "Boswell appealing to Baretti for a testimony of the truth
      is comical enough! I never addressed <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg281" id="pg281">281</a></span> him (Johnson)
      so familiarly in my life. I never did eat any supper, and there
      were no larks to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon mentioning this story to my friend Mr. Wilkes," adds
      Boswell, "he pleasantly matched it with the following sentimental
      anecdote. He was invited by a young man of fashion at Paris to
      sup with him and a lady who had been for some time his mistress,
      but with whom he was going to part. He said to Mr. Wilkes that he
      really felt very much for her, she was in such distress, and that
      he meant to make her a present of 200 louis d'ors. Mr. Wilkes
      observed the behaviour of Mademoiselle, who sighed indeed very
      piteously, and assumed every pathetic air of grief, but ate no
      less than three French pigeons, which are as large as English
      partridges, besides other things. Mr. Wilkes whispered the
      gentleman, 'We often say in England, "Excessive sorrow is
      exceeding dry," but I never heard "Excessive sorrow is exceeding
      hungry." Perhaps one hundred will do. The gentleman took the
      hint." Mrs. Piozzi's marginal ebullition is: "Very like my hearty
      supper of larks, who never eat supper at all, nor was ever a hot
      dish seen on the table after dinner at Streatham Park."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two instances of inaccuracy, announced as particularly worthy of
      notice, are supplied by "an eminent critic," understood to be
      Malone, who begins by stating, "I have often been in his
      (Johnson's) company, and never <i>once</i> heard him say a severe
      thing to any one; and many others can attest the same." Malone
      had lived very little with Johnson, and to appreciate his
      evidence, we should know what he <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg282" id="pg282">282</a></span> and Boswell would agree to call
      a severe thing. Once, on Johnson's observing that they had "good
      talk" on the "preceding evening," "Yes, Sir," replied Boswell,
      "you tossed and gored several persons." Do tossing and goring
      come within the definition of severity? In another place he says,
      "I have seen even Mrs. Thrale stunned;" and Miss Reynolds relates
      that "One day at her own table he spoke so very roughly to her,
      that every one present was surprised that she could bear it so
      placidly; and on the ladies withdrawing, I expressed great
      astonishment that Dr. Johnson should speak so harshly to her, but
      to this she said no more than 'Oh, dear, good man.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the two instances of Mrs. Piozzi's inaccuracy is as
      follows:&mdash;"He once bade a very celebrated lady (Hannah More)
      who praised him with too much zeal perhaps, or perhaps too strong
      an emphasis (which always offended him) consider what her
      flattery was worth before she choaked <i>him</i> with it."
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      Now, exclaims Mr. Malone, let the genuine anecdote be contrasted
      with this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person thus represented as being harshly treated, though a
      very celebrated lady, was <i>then</i> just come to London from an
      obscure situation in the country. At Sir Joshua Reynolds's one
      evening, she met Dr. Johnson. She very soon began to pay her
      court to him in the most fulsome strain. 'Spare me, I beseech
      you, dear Madam,' was his reply. She still <i>laid it on</i>.
      'Pray, Madam, let us have no more of this,' he rejoined. Not
      paying any attention to these warnings, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg283" id="pg283">283</a></span> she continued
      still her eulogy. At length, provoked by this indelicate and
      <i>vain</i> obtrusion of compliments, he exclaimed, 'Dearest
      lady, consider with yourself what your flattery is worth, before
      you bestow it so freely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "How different does this story appear, when accompanied with all
      those circumstances which really belong to it, but which Mrs.
      Thrale either did not know, or has suppressed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we know that these circumstances really belong to it? what
      essential difference do they make? and how do they prove Mrs.
      Thrale's inaccuracy, who expressly states the nature of the
      probable, though certainly most inadequate, provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other instance is a story which she tells on Mr. Thrale's
      authority, of an argument between Johnson and a gentleman, which
      the master of the house, a nobleman, tried to cut short by saying
      loud enough for the doctor to hear, "Our friend has no meaning in
      all this, except just to relate at the Club to-morrow how he
      teased Johnson at dinner to-day; this is all to do himself
      honour." "No, upon my word," replied the other, "I see no honour
      in it, whatever you may do." "Well, Sir," returned Mr. Johnson
      sternly, "if you do not see the honour, I am sure I feel the
      disgrace." Malone, on the authority of a nameless friend, asserts
      that it was not at the house of a nobleman, that the gentleman's
      remark was uttered in a low tone, and that Johnson made no retort
      at all. As Mrs. Piozzi could hardly have invented the story, the
      sole question is, whether Mr. Thrale or Malone's friend was
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg284" id="pg284">284</a></span>
      right. She has written in the margin: "It was the house of Thomas
      Fitzmaurice, son to Lord Shelburne, and Pottinger the
      hero."<span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Piozzi," says Boswell, "has given a similar
      misrepresentation of Johnson's treatment of Garrick in this
      particular (as to the Club), as if he had used these contemptuous
      expressions: 'If Garrick does apply, I'll blackball him. Surely
      one ought to sit in a society like ours&mdash;
    </p>

      <p>
        "'Unelbow'd by a gamester, pimp, or player.'"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The lady retorts, "He did say so, and Mr. Thrale stood
      astonished." Johnson was constantly depreciating the profession
      of the stage.<span class="fnref">[2]</span>

        ballad-singer?"&mdash;<i>Boswell's Life of Johnson</i>, p. 556.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Whilst finding fault with Mrs. Piozzi for inaccuracy in another
      place, Boswell supplies an additional example of Johnson's
      habitual disregard of the ordinary rules of good breeding in
      society:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A learned gentleman [Dr. Vansittart], who, in the course of
      conversation, wished to inform us of this simple fact, that the
      council upon the circuit of Shrewsbury were much bitten by fleas,
      took, I suppose, seven or eight minutes in relating it
      circumstantially. He in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg285"
      id="pg285">285</a></span> plenitude of phrase told us, that large
      bales of woollen cloth were lodged in the town-hall; that by
      reason of this, fleas nestled there in prodigious numbers; that
      the lodgings of the council were near the town-hall; and that
      those little animals moved from place to place with wonderful
      agility. Johnson sat in great impatience till the gentleman had
      finished his tedious narrative, and then burst out (playfully
      however), 'It is a pity, Sir, that you have not seen a lion; for
      a flea has taken you such a time, that a lion must have served
      you a twelve-month.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He complains in a note that Mrs. Piozzi, to whom he told the
      anecdote, has related it "as if the gentleman had given the
      natural history of the mouse." But, in a letter to Johnson she
      tells <i>him</i> "I have seen the man that saw the mouse," and he
      replies "Poor V&mdash;&mdash;, he is a good man, &amp;c.;" so
      that her version of the story is the best authenticated. Opposite
      Boswell's aggressive paragraph she has written: "I saw old
      Mitchell of Brighthelmstone affront him (Johnson) terribly once
      about fleas. Johnson, being tired of the subject, expressed his
      impatience of it with coarseness. 'Why, Sir,' said the old man,
      'why should not Flea bite o'me be treated as Phlebotomy? It
      empties the capillary vessels.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell's Life of Johnson was not published till 1791; but the
      controversy kindled by the Tour to the Hebrides and the
      Anecdotes, raged fiercely enough to fix general attention and
      afford ample scope for ridicule: "The Bozzi &amp;c. subjects,"
      writes Hannah More <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg286" id=
      "pg286">286</a></span> in April 1786, "are not exhausted, though
      everybody seems heartily sick of them. Everybody, however,
      conspires not to let them drop. <i>That</i>, the Cagliostro, and
      the Cardinal's necklace, spoil all conversation, and destroyed a
      very good evening at Mr. Pepys' last night." In one of Walpole's
      letters about the same time we find:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All conversation turns on a trio of culprits&mdash;Hastings,
      Fitzgerald, and the Cardinal de Rohan.... So much for tragedy.
      Our comic performers are Boswell and Dame Piozzi. The cock
      biographer has fixed a direct lie on the hen, by an advertisement
      in which he affirms that he communicated his manuscript to Madame
      Thrale, and that she made no objection to what he says of her low
      opinion of Mrs. Montagu's book. It is very possible that it might
      not be her real opinion, but was uttered in compliment to
      Johnson, or for fear he should spit in her face if she disagreed
      with him; but how will she get over her not objecting to the
      passage remaining? She must have known, by knowing Boswell, and
      by having a similar intention herself, that his 'Anecdotes' would
      certainly be published: in short, the ridiculous woman will be
      strangely disappointed. As she must have heard that <i>the whole
      first impression of her book was sold the first day</i>, no doubt
      she expected on her landing, to be received like the governor of
      Gibraltar, and to find the road strewed with branches of palm.
      She, and Boswell, and their Hero, are the joke of the public. A
      Dr. Walcot, <i>soi-disant</i> Peter Pindar, has published a
      burlesque eclogue, in which Boswell and the Signora are the
      interlocutors, and all <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg287" id=
      "pg287">287</a></span> the absurdest passages in the works of
      both are ridiculed. The print-shops teem with satiric prints in
      them: one in which Boswell, as a monkey, is riding on Johnson,
      the bear, has this witty inscription, 'My Friend
      <i>delineavit</i>.' But enough of these mountebanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      What Walpole calls the absurdest passages are precisely those
      which possess most interest for posterity; namely, the minute
      personal details, which bring Johnson home to the mind's eye.
      Peter Pindar, however, was simply labouring in his vocation when
      he made the best of them, as in the following lines. His satire
      is in the form of a Town Eclogue, in which Bozzy and Madame
      Piozzi contend in anecdotes, with Hawkins for umpire:

      Walpole's opinion of the book itself had been expressed in a
      preceding letter, dated March 28th, 1786:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days ago appeared Madame Piozzi's Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson.
      I am lamentably disappointed&mdash;in her, I mean: not in him. I
      had conceived a favourable opinion of her capacity. But this new
      book is wretched; a high-varnished preface to a heap of rubbish
      in a very vulgar style, and too void of method even for such a
      farrago. . . The Signora talks of her doctor's <i>expanded</i>
      mind and has contributed her mite to show that never mind was
      narrower. In fact, the poor woman is to be pitied: he was mad,
      and his disciples did not find it out<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, but have unveiled all his defects; nay, have
      exhibited all his brutalities as wit, and his worst conundrums as
      humour. Judge! The Piozzi relates that a young man asking him
      where Palmyra was, he replied: 'In Ireland: it was a bog planted
      with palm trees.'"

    <p>
      Walpole's statement, that the whole first impression was sold the
      first day, is confirmed by one of her letters, and may be placed
      alongside of a statement of Johnson's reported in the book.
      Clarissa being mentioned as a perfect character, "on the contrary
      (said he) you may observe that there is always something which
      she prefers to truth. Fielding's Amelia was the most pleasing
      heroine of all the romances; but that vile broken nose never
      cured, ruined the sale of perhaps the only book, which, being
      printed off betimes one morning, a new edition was called for
      before night." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg291" id=
      "pg291">291</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the king sent for a copy of the "Anecdotes" on the evening
      of the publication, there was none to be had.
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      In April, 1786, Hannah More writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Piozzi's book is much in fashion. It is indeed
      entertaining, but there are two or three passages exceedingly
      unkind to Garrick which filled me with indignation. If Johnson
      had been envious enough to utter them, she might have been
      prudent enough to suppress them."
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      In a preceding letter she had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boswell tells me he is printing anecdotes of Dr. Johnson, not
      his <i>life</i>, but, as he has the vanity to call it, his
      <i>pyramid</i>, I besought his tenderness for our virtuous and
      most revered departed friend, and begged he would mitigate some
      of his asperities. He said roughly, he would not cut off his
      claws, nor make a tiger a cat to please anybody." The retort will
      serve for both Mrs. Piozzi and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi writes from Venice, May 20th, 1786: "Cadell says he
      never yet published a work the sale of which was so rapid, and
      that rapidity of so long continuance. I suppose the fifth edition
      will meet me at my return."
    </p>
    <p class="quotdate">
      "Milan, July 6th, 1786.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Cadell would send me some copies, I should be very much
      obliged to him. <i>'Tis like living without a looking-glass never
      to see one's own book so</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      The copy of the "Anecdotes" in my possession has two inscriptions
      on the blank leaves before the title-page. The one is in Mrs.
      Piozzi's handwriting: "This <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg292"
      id="pg292">292</a></span> little dirty book is kindly accepted by
      Sir James Fellowes from his obliged friend, H.L. Piozzi, 14th
      February, 1816;" the other: "This copy of the 'Anecdotes' was
      found at Bath, covered with dirt, the book having been long out
      of print<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and after being bound was
      presented to me by my excellent friend, H.L.P. (signed) J.F."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] The "Anecdotes" were reprinted by Messrs. Longman in 1856,
        and form part of their "Traveller's Library."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It is enriched by marginal notes in her handwriting, which enable
      us to fill up a few puzzling blanks, besides supplying some
      information respecting men and books, which will be prized by all
      lovers of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the anecdotes runs thus: "I asked him once concerning the
      conversation powers of a gentleman with whom I was myself
      unacquainted. 'He talked to me at the Club one day (replies our
      Doctor) concerning Catiline's conspiracy; so I withdrew my
      attention, and thought about Tom Thumb.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the margin is written "Charles James Fox." Mr. Croker came to
      the conclusion that the gentleman was Mr. Vesey. Boswell says
      that Fox never talked with any freedom in the presence of
      Johnson, who accounted for his reserve by suggesting that a man
      who is used to the applause of the House of Commons, has no wish
      for that of a private company. But the real cause was his
      sensitiveness to rudeness, his own temper being singularly sweet.
      By an odd coincidence he occupied the presidential chair at the
      Club on the evening when Johnson emphatically declared patriotism
      the last refuge of a scoundrel. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg293" id="pg293">293</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: "On an occasion of less consequence, when he turned his
      back on Lord Bolingbroke in the rooms of Brighthelmstone, he made
      this excuse: 'I am not obliged, Sir,' said he to Mr. Thrale, who
      stood fretting, 'to find reasons for respecting the rank of him
      who will not condescend to declare it by his dress or some other
      visible mark: what are stars and other signs of superiority made
      for?' The next evening, however, he made us comical amends, by
      sitting by the same nobleman, and haranguing very loudly about
      the nature, and use, and abuse, of divorces. Many people gathered
      round them to hear what was said, and when my husband called him
      away, and told him to whom he had been talking, received an
      answer which I will not write down."
    </p>
    <p>
      The marginal note is: "He said: 'Why, Sir, I did not know the
      man. If he will put on no other mark of distinction, let us make
      him wear his horns.'" Lord Bolingbroke had divorced his wife,
      afterwards Lady Diana Beauclerc, for infidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marginal note naming the lady of quality (Lady Catherine Wynne)
      mentioned in the following anecdote, verifies Mr. Croker's
      conjectural statement concerning her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a lady of quality, since dead, who received us at her
      husband's seat in Wales, with less attention than he had long
      been accustomed to, he had a rougher denunciation: 'That woman,'
      cries Johnson, 'is like sour small beer, the beverage of her
      table, and produce of the wretched country she lives in: like
      that, she could <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg294" id=
      "pg294">294</a></span> never have been a good thing, and even
      that bad thing is spoiled.' It was in the same vein of asperity,
      and I believe with something like the same provocation, that he
      observed of a Scotch lady, 'that she resembled a dead nettle;
      were she alive,' said he, 'she would sting.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      From similar notes we learn that the "somebody" who declared
      Johnson "a tremendous converser" was George Grarrick; and that it
      was Dr. Delap, of Sussex, to whom, when lamenting the tender
      state of his <i>inside</i>, he cried out: "Dear Doctor, do not be
      like the spider, man, and spin conversation thus incessantly out
      of thy own bowels."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the margin of the page in which Hawkins Browne is commended as
      the most delightful of conversers, she has written: "Who wrote
      the 'Imitation of all the Poets' in his own ludicrous verses,
      praising the pipe of tobacco. Of Hawkins Browne, the pretty Mrs.
      Cholmondeley said she was soon tired; because the first hour he
      was so dull, there was no bearing him; the second he was so
      witty, there was no bearing him; the third he was so drunk, there
      was no bearing him." <span class="fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Query, whether this is the gentleman immortalised by Peter
        Plymley: "In the third year of his present Majesty (George
        III.) and in the thirtieth of his own age, Mr. Isaac Hawkins
        Brown, then upon his travels, danced one evening at the court
        of Naples. His dress was a volcano silk, with lava buttons.
        Whether (as the Neapolitan wits said) he had studied dancing
        under Saint Vitus, or whether David, dancing in a linen vest,
        was his model, is not known; but Mr. Brown danced with such
        inconceivable alacrity and vigour, that he threw the Queen of
        Naples into convulsions of laughter, which terminated in a
        miscarriage, and changed the dynasty of the Neapolitan throne."
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg295" id="pg295">295</a></span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the "Anecdotes" she relates that one day in Wales she meant to
      please Johnson with a dish of young peas. "Are they not
      charming?" said I, while he was eating them. "Perhaps," said he,
      "they would be so&mdash;to a pig;" meaning (according to the
      marginal note), because they were too little boiled. Pennant, the
      historian, used to tell this as having happened at Mrs. Cotton's,
      who, according to him, called out, "Then do help yourself, Mr.
      Johnson." But the well-known high breeding of the lady justifies
      a belief that this is one of the many repartees which, if
      conceived, were never uttered at the time.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] I have heard on good authority that Pennant afterwards
        owned it as his own invention.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When a Lincolnshire lady, shewing Johnson a grotto, asked him:
      "Would it not be a pretty cool habitation in summer?" he replied:
      "I think it would, Madam, <i>for a toad</i>." Talking of Gray's
      Odes, he said, "They are forced plants, raised in a hotbed; and
      they are poor plants: they are but cucumbers after all." A
      gentleman present, who had been running down ode-writing in
      general, as a bad species of poetry, unluckily said, "Had they
      been literally cucumbers, they had been better things than odes."
      "Yes, Sir," said Johnson, "<i>for a hog</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the Anecdotes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the various states and conditions of humanity, he despised
      none more, I think, than the man who marries for maintenance: and
      of a friend who made his alliance on no higher principles, he
      said once, 'Now <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg296" id=
      "pg296">296</a></span> has that fellow,' it was a nobleman of
      whom we were speaking, 'at length obtained a certainty of three
      meals a day, and for that certainty, like his brother dog in the
      fable, he will get his neck galled for life with a collar.'" The
      nobleman was Lord Sandys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He recommended, on something like the same principle, that when
      one person meant to serve another, he should not go about it
      slily, or, as we say, underhand, out of a false idea of delicacy,
      to surprise one's friend with an unexpected favour; 'which, ten
      to one,' says he, 'fails to oblige your acquaintance, who had
      some reasons against such a mode of obligation, which you might
      have known but for that superfluous cunning which you think an
      elegance. Oh! never be seduced by such silly pretences,'
      continued he; 'if a wench wants a good gown, do not give her a
      fine smelling-bottle, because that is more delicate: as I once
      knew a lady lend the key of her library to a poor scribbling
      dependant, as if she took the woman for an ostrich that could
      digest iron.'" This lady was Mrs. Montagu.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mentioned two friends who were particularly fond of looking at
      themselves in a glass&mdash;'They do not surprise me at all by so
      doing,' said Johnson: 'they see reflected in that glass, men who
      have risen from almost the lowest situations in life; one to
      enormous riches, the other to everything this world can
      give&mdash;rank, fame, and fortune. They see, likewise, men who
      have merited their advancement by the exertion and improvement of
      those talents which God had given them; and I see not why they
      should avoid the mirror.'" The one, she <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg297" id="pg297">297</a></span> writes, was
      Mr. Cator, the other, Wedderburne. Another great lawyer and very
      ugly man, Dunning, Lord Ashburton, was remarkable for the same
      peculiarity, and had his walls covered with looking-glasses. His
      personal vanity was excessive; and his boast that a celebrated
      courtesan had died with one of his letters in her hand, provoked
      one of Wilkes's happiest repartees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite a passage descriptive of Johnson's conversation she has
      written: "We used to say to one another familiarly at Streatham
      Park, 'Come, let us go into the library, and make Johnson speak
      Ramblers.'"

      Thrale is at her own house at Brighthelmstone, accompanied by a

      Johnson published by a Dr. Towers, a Dissenting minister and Dr.

      take it for granted this life is to be hashed up again when the
      letter 'J' takes its turn. There is nothing new in it; and the
      author gives Johnson and his biographers all fair play, except
      when he treats of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg298" id=

      hear of her arrival. I do not believe that she purchased a
      marquisate abroad; but it is said, with some probability, that
      she will here get the King's license, or an act of Parliament, to
      change her name to Salusbury, her maiden name. Sir John Hawkins,

      had been that morning at the bank to get 'Johnson's

    <p>
      "1786.&mdash;It has always been my maxim never to influence the
      inclination of another: Mr. Thrale, in consequence, lived with me
      seventeen and a half years, during which time I tried but twice
      to persuade him to <i>do</i> anything, and but once, and that in
      vain, to let anything alone. Even my daughters, as soon as they
      could reason, were always allowed, and even encouraged, by me to
      reason their own way, and not suffer their <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg300" id="pg300">300</a></span> respect or
      affection for me to mislead their judgment. Let us keep the mind
      clear if we can from prejudices, or truth will never be found at
      all.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> The worst part of this
      disinterested scheme is, that other people are not of my mind,
      and if I resolve not to use my lawful influence to make my
      children love me, the lookers-on will soon use their unlawful
      influence to make them hate me: if I scrupulously avoid
      persuading my husband to become a Lutheran or be of the English
      church, the Romanists will be diligent to teach him all the
      narrowness and bitterness of their own unfeeling sect, and soon
      persuade him that it is not delicacy but weakness makes me desist
      from the combat. Well! let me do right, and leave the
      consequences in His hand who alone sees every action's motive and
      the true cause of every effect: let me endeavour to please God,
      and to have only my own faults and follies, not those of another,
      to answer for."

      In the Conway Notes, she thus sums up her life from March 1787 to
      1791:
    </p>
    <p>
      "On first reaching London, we drove to the Royal Hotel in Pall
      Mall, and, arriving early, I proposed going to the Play. There
      was a small front box, in those days, which held only two; it
      made the division, or connexion, with the side boxes, and, being
      unoccupied, we sat in it, and saw Mrs. Siddons act Imogen, I well
      remember, and Mrs. Jordan, Priscilla Tomboy. Mr. Piozzi was
      amused, and the next day was spent in looking at houses, counting
      the cards left by old acquaintances, &amp;c. The lady-daughters
      came, behaved with cold civility, and asked what I thought of
      <i>their</i> decision concerning Cecilia, then at school. No
      reply was made, or a gentle one; but she was the first cause of
      contention among us. The lawyers gave her into my care, and we
      took her home to our new habitation in Hanover Square, which we
      opened with music, cards, &amp;c., on, I think, the 22nd March.
      Miss Thrales refused their company; so we managed as well as we
      could. Our affairs were in good order, and money ready for
      spending. The World, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg306" id=
      "pg306">306</a></span> it is called, appeared good-humoured, and
      we were soon followed, respected, and admired. The summer months
      sent us about visiting and pleasuring, ... and after another gay
      London season, Streatham Park, unoccupied by tenants, called us
      as if <i>really home</i>. Mr. Piozzi, with more generosity than
      prudence, spent two thousand pounds on repairing and furnishing
      it in 1790;&mdash;and we had danced all night, I recollect, when
      the news came of Louis Seize's escape from, and recapture by, his
      rebel subjects.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are some of the names most frequently mentioned in
      her Diary as visiting or corresponding with her after her return
      from Italy: Lord Fife, Dr. Moore, the Kembles, Dr. Currie, Mrs.

      Resentment for her imputed unkindness to Johnson might have been
      expected to last longest at his birthplace. But Miss Seward
      writes from Lichfield, October 6th, 1787: <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg307" id="pg307">307</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Piozzi completely answers your description: her
      conversation is indeed that bright wine of the intellects which
      has no lees.... I shall always feel indebted to him (Mr. Perkins)
      for eight or nine hours of Mr. and Mrs. Piozzi's society. They
      passed one evening here, and I the next with them at their inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again to Miss Helen Williams, Lichfield, December, 25th, 1787:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is very true, on the evening he (Colonel Barry)
      mentioned to you, when Mrs. Piozzi honoured this roof, his
      conversation greatly contributed to its Attic spirit. Till that
      day I had never conversed with her. There has been no
      exaggeration, there could be none, in the description given you
      of Mrs. Piozzi's talents for conversation; at least in the powers
      of classic allusion and brilliant wit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi's next publication was "Letters To and From the late
      Samuel Johnson, LL.D., &amp;c." In the Preface she speaks of the
      "Anecdotes" having been received with a degree of approbation she
      hardly dared to hope, and exclaims, "May these Letters in some
      measure pay my debt of gratitude! they will not surely be the
      <i>first</i>, the <i>only</i> thing written by Johnson, with
      which our nation has not been pleased." ... "The good taste by
      which our countrymen are distinguished, will lead them to prefer
      the native thoughts and unstudied phrases scattered over these
      pages to the more laboured elegance of his other works; as bees
      have been observed to reject roses, and fix upon the wild
      fragrance of a neighbouring heath." <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg308" id="pg308">308</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Johnson took pen in hand, the chances were, that what he
      produced would belong to the composite order; the unstudied
      phrases were reserved for his "talk;" and he wished his Letters
      to be preserved.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> The main value of
      these consists in the additional illustrations they afford of his
      conduct in private life, and of his opinions on the management of
      domestic affairs. The lack of literary and public interest is
      admitted and excused:

      In "Thraliana" she thus refers to the reception of the book:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Letters are out. They were published on Saturday, 8th of
      March. Cadell printed 2,000 copies, and says 1,100 are already
      sold. My letter to Jack Rice on his marriage (Vol. i. p. 96),
      seems the universal favourite. The book is well spoken of on the
      whole; yet Cadell murmurs. I cannot make out why."
    </p>
    <p>
      This entry is not dated; the next is dated March 27th, 1788.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This collection," says Boswell, "as a proof of the high
      estimation set on any thing that came from his pen, was sold by
      that lady for the sum of 500<i>l</i>." She has written on the
      margin: "How spiteful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell states that "Horace Walpole thought Johnson a more
      amiable character after reading his Letters to Mrs. Thrale, but
      never was one of the true admirers of that great man." Madame
      D'Arblay came to an opposite conclusion; in her Diary, January
      9th, 1788, she writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day Mrs. Schwellenberg did me a real favour, and with real
      good nature, for she sent me the letters of my poor lost friends,
      Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale, which she knew me to be almost
      pining to procure. The book belongs to the Bishop of Carlisle,
      who lent it to Mr. Turbulent, from whom it was again lent to the
      Queen, and so passed on to Mrs. S. It is still unpublished. With
      what a sadness have I been reading! What scenes has it revived!
      What regrets renewed! These letters have not been more improperly
      published in the whole than they are injudiciously displayed in
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg310" id="pg310">310</a></span>
      their several parts. She has given all, every word, and thinks
      that perhaps a justice to Dr. Johnson, which, in fact, is the
      greatest injury to his memory.

      "The few she has selected of her own do her, indeed, much credit;
      she has discarded all that were trivial and merely local, and
      given only such as contain something instructive, amusing, or
      ingenious."
    </p>
    <p>
      She admits only four of Johnson's letters to be worthy of his
      exalted powers: one upon Death, in considering its approach, as
      we are surrounded, or not, by mourners; another upon the sudden
      death of Mrs. Thrale's only son. Her chief motive for "almost
      pining" for the book, steeped as she was in egotism, may be
      guessed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our name once occurred; how I started at its sight! 'Tis to
      mention the party that planned the first visit to our house."
    </p>
    <p>
      She says she had so many attacks upon "her (Mrs. Piozzi's)
      subject," that at last she fairly begged quarter. Yet nothing she
      could say could put a stop to, "How can you defend her in this?
      how can you justify her in that? &amp;c. &amp;c." "Alas! that I
      cannot defend her is precisely the reason I can so ill bear to
      speak of her. How differently and how sweetly has the Queen
      conducted herself upon this occasion. Eager to see the Letters,
      she began reading them with the utmost avidity. A natural
      curiosity arose to be informed of several names and several
      particulars, which she knew I could satisfy; yet when she
      perceived how tender a string she touched, she soon suppressed
      her inquiries, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg311" id=
      "pg311">311</a></span> only made them with so much gentleness
      towards the parties mentioned, that I could not be distressed in
      my answers; and even in a short time I found her questions made
      in so favourable a disposition, that I began secretly to rejoice
      in them, as the means by which I reaped opportunity of clearing
      several points that had been darkened by calumny, and of
      softening others that had been viewed wholly through false
      lights. To lessen disapprobation of a person, and so precious to
      me in the opinion of another, so respectable both in rank and
      virtue, was to me a most soothing task, &amp;c."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is precisely what many will take the liberty to doubt; or
      why did she shrink from it, or why did she not afford to others
      the explanations which proved so successful with the Queen?
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following (Jan. 10th), her feelings were so worked upon
      by the harsh aspersions on her friend, that she was forced, she
      tells us, abruptly to quit the room; leaving not her own (like
      Sir Peter Teazle) but her friend's character behind her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I returned when I could, and the subject was over. When all were
      gone, Mrs. Schwellenberg said, 'I have told it Mr. Fisher, that
      he drove you out from the room, and he says he won't do it no
      more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She told me next, that in the second volume I also, was
      mentioned. Where she may have heard this I cannot gather, but it
      has given me a sickness at heart, inexpressible. It is not that I
      expect severity; for at the time of that correspondence, at all
      times indeed previous to the marriage with Piozzi, if Mrs. Thrale
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg312" id="pg312">312</a></span>
      loved not F. B., where shall we find faith in words, or give
      credit to actions. But her present resentment, however unjustly
      incurred, of my constant disapprobation of her conduct, may
      prompt some note, or other mark, to point out her change of
      sentiment. But let me try to avoid such painful expectations; at
      least not to dwell upon them. O, little does she know how
      tenderly at this moment I could run into her arms, so often
      opened to receive me with a cordiality I believed inalienable.
      And it was sincere then, I am satisfied; pride, resentment of
      disapprobation, and consciousness if unjustifiable
      proceedings&mdash;these have now changed her; but if we met, and
      she saw and believed my faithful regard, how would she again feel
      all her own return! Well, what a dream I am making!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ingrained worldliness of the diarist is ill-concealed by the
      mask of sensibility. The correspondence that passed between the
      ladies during their temporary rupture (<i>antè</i>, p. 230) shews
      that there was nothing to prevent her from flying into her
      friend's arms, could she have made up her mind to be seen on open
      terms of affectionate intimacy with one who was repudiated by the
      Court. In a subsequent conversation with which the Queen honoured
      her on the subject, she did her best to impress her Majesty with
      the belief that Mrs. Piozzi's conduct had rendered it impossible
      for her former friends to allude to her without regret, and she
      ended by thanking her royal mistress for her forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," cried she, with eyes strongly expressive of the
      complacency with which she heard me, "I have <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg313" id="pg313">313</a></span> always spoken
      as little as possible upon this affair. I remember but twice that
      I have named it: once I said to the Bishop of Carlisle that I
      thought most of these letters had better have been spared the
      printing; and once to Mr. Langton, at the drawing-room I said,
      'Your friend Dr. Johnson, Sir, has had many friends busy to
      publish his books, and his memoirs, and his meditations, and his
      thoughts; but I think he wanted one friend more.' 'What for,
      Ma'am?' cried he. 'A friend to suppress them,' I answered. And,
      indeed, this is all I ever said about the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah More's opinion of the Letters is thus expressed in her
      Memoirs:
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are such as ought to have been written but ought not to
      have been printed: a few of them are very good: sometimes he is
      moral, and sometimes he is kind. The imprudence of editors and
      executors is an additional reason why men of parts should be
      afraid to die.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Burke said to me the
      other day, in allusion to the innumerable lives, anecdotes,
      remains, &amp;c. of this great man, 'How many maggots have
      crawled out of that great body!'"
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] In reference to the late Lord Campbell's "Lives of the Lord
        Chancellors," it was remarked, that, as regards persons who had
        attained the dignity, the threatened continuation of the work
        had added a new pang to death. I am assured by the
        Ex-Chancellor to whom I attributed this joke, that it was made
        by Sir Charles Wetherell at a dinner at Lincoln's-Inn.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Miss Seward writes to Mrs. Knowles, April, 1788:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now what say you to the last publication of your sister wit,
      Mrs. Piozzi? It is well that she has <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg314" id="pg314">314</a></span> had the good
      nature to extract almost all the corrosive particles from the old
      growler's letters. By means of her benevolent chemistry, these
      effusions of that expansive but gloomy spirit taste more oily and
      sweet than one could have imagined possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters contained two or three passages relating to Baretti,
      which exasperated him to the highest pitch. One was in a letter
      from Johnson, dated July 15th, 1775:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor says, that if Mr. Thrale comes so near as Derby
      without seeing us, it will be a sorry trick. I wish, for my part,
      that he may return soon, and rescue the fair captives from the
      tyranny of B&mdash;&mdash;i. Poor B&mdash;&mdash;i! do not
      quarrel with him; to neglect him a little will be sufficient. He
      means only to be frank, and manly, and independent, and perhaps,
      as you say, a little wise. To be frank, he thinks is to be
      cynical, and to be independent, is to be rude. Forgive him,
      dearest lady, the rather, because of his misbehaviour, I am
      afraid he learned part of me. I hope to set him hereafter a
      better example."
    </p>
    <p>
      The most galling was in a letter of hers to Dr. Johnson:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does Dr. Taylor do? He was very kind I remember when my
      thunder-storm came first on, so was Count Manucci, so was Mrs.
      Montagu, so was everybody. The world is not guilty of much
      general harshness, nor inclined I believe to increase pain which
      they do not perceive to be deserved.&mdash;Baretti alone tried to
      irritate a wound so very deeply inflicted, and he will find few
      to approve his cruelty. Your friendship <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg315" id="pg315">315</a></span> is our best
      cordial; continue it to us, dear Sir, and write very soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the margin of the printed copy is written, "Cruel, cruel
      Baretti." He had twitted her, whilst mourning over a dead child,
      with having killed it by administering a quack medicine instead
      of attending to the physician's prescriptions; a charge which he
      acknowledged and repeated in print. He published three successive
      papers in "The European Magazine" for 1788, assailing her with
      the coarsest ribaldry. "I have just read for the first time,"
      writes Miss Seward in June, 1788, "the base, ungentleman-like,
      unmanly abuse of Mrs. Piozzi by that Italian assassin, Baretti.
      The whole literary world should unite in publicly reprobating
      such venomed and foul-mouthed railing." He died soon afterwards,
      May 5th, 1789, and the notice of him in the "Gentleman's
      Magazine" begins: "Mrs. Piozzi has reason to rejoice in the death
      of Mr. Baretti, for he had a very long memory and malice to
      relate all he knew." And a good deal that he did not know, into
      the bargain; as when he prints a pretended conversation between
      Mr. and Mrs. Thrale about Piozzi, which he afterwards admits to
      be a gratuitous invention and rhetorical figure of his own, for
      conveying what is a foolish falsehood on the face of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti's death is thus noticed in "Thraliana," 8th May, 1789:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baretti is dead. Poor Baretti! I am sincerely sorry for him, and
      as Zanga says, 'If I lament thee, sure thy worth was great.' He
      was a manly character, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg316" id=
      "pg316">316</a></span> at worst, and died, as he lived, less like
      a Christian than a philosopher, refusing all spiritual or
      corporeal assistance, both which he considered useless to him,
      and perhaps they were so. He paid his debts, called in some
      single acquaintance, told him he was dying, and drove away that
      <i>Panada</i> conversation which friends think proper to
      administer at sick-bedsides with becoming steadiness, bid him
      write his brothers word that he was dead, and gently desired a
      woman who waited to leave him quite alone. No interested
      attendants watching for ill-deserved legacies, no harpy relatives
      clung round the couch of Baretti. He died!
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'And art thou dead? so is my enmity:
      </p>
      <p>
        I war not with the dead.'
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Baretti's papers&mdash;manuscripts I mean&mdash;have been all
      burnt by his executors without examination, they tell me. So
      great was his character as a mischief-maker, that Vincent and
      Fendall saw no nearer way to safety than that hasty and
      compendious one. Many people think 'tis a good thing for me, but
      as I never trusted the man, I see little harm he could have done
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fury of his onslaught Baretti forgot that he was
      strengthening her case against Johnson, of whom he says: "His
      austere reprimand, and unrestrained upbraidings, when face to
      face with her, always delighted Mr. Thrale and were approved even
      by her children. 'Harry,' said his father to her son, 'are you
      listening to what the doctor and mamma are talking about?' 'Yes,
      papa.' And quoth Mr. Thrale, 'What <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg317" id="pg317">317</a></span> are they saying?' 'They are
      disputing, and mamma has just such a chance with Dr. Johnson as
      Presto (a little dog) would have were he to fight Dash (a big
      one).'" He adds that she left the room in a huff to the amusement
      of the party. If scenes like this were frequent, no wonder the
      "yoke" became unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baretti was obliged to admit that, when Johnson died, they were
      not on speaking terms. His explanation is that Johnson irritated
      him by an allusion to his being beaten by Omai, the Sandwich
      Islander, at chess. Mrs. Piozzi's marginal note on Omai is: "When
      Omai played at chess and at backgammon with Baretti, everybody
      admired at the savage's good breeding and at the European's
      impatient spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst her papers was the following sketch of his character,
      written for "The World" newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mr. Conductor</i>.&mdash;Let not the death of Baretti pass
      unnoticed by 'The World,' seeing that Baretti was a wit if not a
      scholar: and had for five-and-thirty years at least lived in a
      foreign country, whose language he so made himself completely
      master of, that he could satirise its inhabitants in their own
      tongue, better than they knew how to defend themselves; and often
      pleased, without ever praising man or woman in book or
      conversation. Long supported by the private bounty of friends, he
      rather delighted to insult than flatter; he at length obtained
      competence from a public he esteemed not: and died, refusing that
      assistance he considered as useless&mdash;leaving no debts (but
      those of gratitude) undischarged; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg318" id="pg318">318</a></span> and expressing neither regret
      of the past, nor fear of the future, I believe. Strong in his
      prejudices, haughty and independent in his spirit, cruel in his
      anger,&mdash;even when unprovoked; vindictive to excess, if he
      through misconception supposed himself even slightly injured,
      pertinacious in his attacks, invincible in his aversions: the
      description of Menelaus in 'Homer's Iliad,' as rendered by Pope,
      exactly suits the character of Baretti:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "'So burns the vengeful Hornet, soul all o'er,
      </p>
      <p>
        Repuls'd in vain, and thirsty still for gore;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bold son of air and heat on angry wings,
      </p>
      <p>
        Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.'"
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In reference to this article, she remarks in "Thraliana":
    </p>
    <p>
      "There seems to be a language now appropriated to the newspapers,
      and a very wretched and unmeaning language it is. Yet a certain
      set of expressions are so necessary to please the diurnal
      readers, that when Johnson and I drew up an advertisement for
      charity once, I remember the people altered our expressions and
      substituted their own, with good effect too. The other day I sent
      a Character of Baretti to 'The World,' and read it two mornings
      after more altered than improved in my mind: but no matter: they
      will talk of <i>wielding</i> a language, and of <i>barbarous</i>
      infamy,&mdash;sad stuff, to be sure, but such is the taste of the
      times. They altered even my quotation from Pope; but that was too
      impudent."
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparison of Baretti to the hornet was truer <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg319" id="pg319">319</a></span> than she
      anticipated: <i>animamque in vulnere ponit</i>. Internal evidence
      leads almost irresistibly to the conclusion that he was the
      author or prompter of "The <i>Sentimental</i> Mother: a Comedy in
      Five Acts. The Legacy of an Old Friend, and his 'Last Moral
      Lesson' to Mrs. Hester Lynch Thrale, now Mrs. Hester Lynch
      Piozzi. London: Printed for James Ridgeway, York Street, St.
      James's Square, 1789. Price three shillings." The principal
      <i>dramatis personæ</i> are Mr. Timothy Tunskull (Thrale), Lady
      Fantasma Tunskull, two Misses Tunskull, and Signor Squalici.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Fantasma is vain, affected, silly, and amorous to excess.
      Not satisfied with Squalici as her established gallant, she makes
      compromising advances to her daughter's lover on his way to a
      <i>tête-à-téte</i> with the young lady, who takes her wonted
      place on his knee with his arm round her waist. Squalici is also
      a domestic spy, and in league with the mother to cheat the
      daughters of their patrimony. Mr. Tunskull is a respectable and
      complacent nonentity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue is seasoned with the same malicious insinuations
      which mark Baretti's letters in the "European Magazine;" without
      the saving clause with which shame or fear induced him to qualify
      them, namely, that no breach of chastity was suspected or
      believed. It is difficult to imagine who else would have thought
      of reverting to Thrale's establishment eight years after it had
      been broken up by death; and in one of his papers in the
      "European Magazine," he holds out a threat that she might find
      herself the subject <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg320" id=
      "pg320">320</a></span> of a play: "Who knows but some one of our
      modern dramatic geniusses may hereafter entertain the public with
      a laughable comedy in five long acts, entitled, with singular
      propriety, 'the <i>Scientific</i> Mother'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi had some-how contracted a belief, to which she
      alludes more than once with unfeigned alarm, that Mr. Samuel
      Lysons had formed a collection of all the libels and caricatures
      of which she was the subject on the occasion of her marriage. His
      collections have been carefully examined, and the sole semblance
      of warrant for her fears is an album or scrap-book containing
      numerous extracts from the reviews and newspapers, relating to
      her books. The only caricature preserved in it is the celebrated
      one by Sayers entitled "Johnson's Ghost." The ghost, a flattering
      likeness of the doctor, addresses a pretty woman seated at a
      writing table:

      When a prize was offered for the best address on the rebuilding
      of Drury Lane, Sheridan proposed an additional <span class=

      one without a phoenix. Equally acceptable for its rarity would be
      a squib on Mrs. Piozzi without a reference to the brewery.

    <p>
      Her manuscript notes on the two volumes of Letters are numerous
      and important, comprising some curious fragments of
      autobiography, written on separate sheets of paper and pasted
      into the volumes opposite to the passages which they expand or
      explain. They would create an inconvenient break in the narrative
      if introduced here, and they are reserved for a separate section.

      Her next literary labour is thus mentioned in "Thraliana":

      She had now taken rank as a popular writer, and thought herself

      "MR. CADELL,&mdash;Sir, this is a letter of business. I have
      finished the book of observations and reflections made in the
      course of my journey thro' France, Italy, and Germany, and if you
      have a mind to purchase the MS. I make you the first offer of it.
      Here, if complaints had any connection with business, I would
      invent a thousand, and they should be very kind ones too; but it
      is better to tell you the size and price of the book. My
      calculations bring it to a thousand pages of letter-press like
      Dr. Moore's; or you might print it in three small volumes, to go
      with the 'Anecdotes.' Be that as it will, the price, at a word
      (as the advertisers say of their horse), is 500 guineas and
      twelve copies to give away, though I will not, like them, warrant
      it free from blemishes. No creature has looked over the papers
      but Lord Huntingdon, and he likes them exceedingly. Direct your
      answer here, if you write immediately; if not, send the letter
      under cover to Mrs. Lewis, London Street, Reading, Berks; and
      believe me, dear Sir, your faithful humble servant,

      Whether these terms were accepted, does not appear; but in Dec.
      1789 she published (Cadell and Strahan) "Observations and
      Reflections made in the course of a Journey through France,
      Italy, and Germany," in two volumes octavo of about 400 pages
      each. As happened to almost everything she did or wrote, this
      book, which she calls the "Travel-book," was by turns assailed
      with inveterate hostility and praised with animated zeal. It
      would seem that sustained calumny had seasoned her against the
      malevolence of criticism. On the passage in Johnson's letter to
      T. Warton, "I am little afraid for myself," her comment is: "That
      is just what I feel when insulted, not about literary though, but
      social quarrels. The others are not worth a thought." In
      "Thraliana," Dec. 30th, 1789, she writes: "I think my
      Observations and Reflexions in Italy, &amp;c., have been, upon
      the whole, exceedingly well liked, and much read."
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      Walpole writes to Mrs. Carter, June 13th, 1789:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mean to misemploy much of your time, which I know is
      always passed in good works, and usefully. You have, therefore,
      probably not looked into Piozzi's Travels. I, who have been
      almost six weeks lying on a couch, have gone through them. It was
      said that Addison might have written his without going out of
      England. By the excessive vulgarisms so plentiful in these
      volumes, one might suppose the writer had never stirred out of
      the parish of St. Giles. Her Latin, French, and Italian, too, are
      so miserably spelt, that she had better have studied her own
      language before she floundered into other tongues. Her friends
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg324" id="pg324">324</a></span>
      plead that she piques herself on writing as she talks: methinks,
      then, she should talk as she would write. There are many
      indiscretions too in her work of which she will perhaps be told
      though Baretti is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Seward, much to her credit, repeated to Mrs. Piozzi both the
      praise and the blame she had expressed to others. On December
      21st, 1789, she writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suffer me now to speak to you of your highly ingenious,
      instructive, and entertaining publication; yet shall it be with
      the sincerity of friendship, rather than with the flourish of
      compliment. No work of the sort I ever read possesses, in an
      equal degree, the power of placing the reader in the scenes and
      amongst the people it describes. Wit, knowledge, and imagination
      illuminate its pages&mdash;but the infinite inequality of the
      style!&mdash;Permit me to acknowledge to you what I have
      acknowledged to others, that it excites my exhaustless wonder,
      that Mrs. Piozzi, the child of genius, the pupil of Johnson,
      should pollute, with the vulgarisms of unpolished conversation,
      her animated pages!&mdash;that, while she frequently displays her
      power of commanding the most chaste and beautiful style
      imaginable, she should generally use those inelegant, those
      strange <i>dids</i>, and <i>does</i>, and <i>thoughs</i>, and
      <i>toos</i>, which produce jerking angles, and stop-short
      abruptness, fatal at once to the grace and ease of the
      sentence;&mdash;which are, in language, what the rusty black silk
      handkerchief and the brass ring are upon the beautiful form of
      the Italian countess she mentions, arrayed in embroidery, and
      blazing in jewels." <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg325" id=
      "pg325">325</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi's theory was that books should he written in the same
      colloquial and idiomatic language which is employed by cultivated
      persons in conversation, "Be thou familiar, but by no means
      vulgar;" and vulgar she certainly was not, although she sometimes
      indulged her fondness for familiarity too far. The period was
      unluckily chosen for carrying such a theory into practice; for
      Johnson's authority had discountenanced idiomatic writing, whilst
      many phrases and forms of speech, which would not be endured now,
      were tolerated in polite society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laws of spelling, too, were unfixed or vague, and those of
      pronunciation, which more or less affect spelling, still more so.
      "When," said Johnson, "I published the plan of my dictionary,
      Lord Chesterfield told me that the word <i>great</i> should be
      pronounced so as to rhyme to <i>state</i>; and Sir William Yonge
      sent me word that it should be pronounced so as to rhyme to
      <i>seat</i>, and that none but an Irishman would pronounce it
      <i>grait</i>. Now here were two men of the highest rank, one the
      best speaker in the House of Lords, the other the best speaker in
      the House of Commons, differing entirely." Mrs. Piozzi has
      written on the margin:&mdash;"Sir William was in the right." Two
      well-known couplets of Pope imply similar changes:&mdash;

      Within living memory, elderly people of quality, both in writing
      and conversation, stuck to Lunnun, Brummagem, and Cheyny (China).
      Charles Fox would not give up "Bour<i>dux</i>." Johnson
      pronounced "heard" <i>heerd</i>. In 1800 "flirtation" was deemed
      a vulgar word.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Lord Byron wrote
      <i>redde</i> (for <i>read</i>, in the past tense), and Lord
      Dudley declined being helped to apple <i>tart</i>. When,
      therefore, we find Mrs. Piozzi using words or idioms rejected by
      modern taste or fastidiousness, we must not be too ready to
      accuse her of ignorance or vulgarity. I have commonly retained
      her original syntax, and her spelling, which frequently varies
      within a page.

      Two days afterwards, Walpole returns to the charge in a letter to
      Miss Berry, which is alone sufficient to prove the worthlessness
      of his literary judgments:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read 'Sindbad the Sailor's Voyages,' and you will be sick of
      Æneas's. What woful invention were the nasty poultry that dunged
      on his dinner, and ships on fire turned into Nereids! A barn
      metamorphosed into a cascade in a pantomime is full as sublime an
      effort of genius.... I do not think the Sultaness's narratives
      very natural or very probable, but there is a wildness in them
      that captivates. However, if you could wade through two octavos
      of Dame Piozzi's <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg327" id=

      trows</i>, and cannot listen to seven volumes of Scheherezade's
      narratives, I will sue for a divorce in foro Parnassi, and
      Boccalini shall be my proctor."

      A single couplet of Gifford's was more damaging than all
      Walpole's petulance:

      <p>
        [1] "She, one evening, asked me abruptly if I did not remember
        the scurrilous lines in which she had been depicted by Gifford
        in his 'Baviad and Moeviad.' And, not waiting for my answer,
        for I was indeed too much embarrassed to give one quickly, she
        recited the verses in question, and added, 'how do you think
        "Thrale's grey widow" revenged herself? I contrived to get
        myself invited to meet him at supper at a friend's house, (I
        think she said in Pall Mall), soon after the publication of his
        poem, sate opposite to him, saw that he was "perplexed in the
        extreme;" and smiling, proposed a glass of wine as a libation
        to our future good fellowship. Gifford was sufficiently a man
        of the world to understand me, and nothing could be more
        courteous and entertaining than he was while we remained
        together.'"&mdash;<i>Piozziana</i>.

    <p>
      This condemnatory verse is every way unjust. The nothings, or
      somethings, which form the staple of the book, are not laboured;
      and they are presented without the semblance of pomp or
      pretension. The Preface commences thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was made to observe at Rome some vestiges of an ancient custom
      very proper in those days. It was the parading of the street by a
      set of people called Preciæ, who went some minutes before the
      Flamen Dialis, to bid the inhabitants leave work or play, and
      attend wholly to the procession; but if ill-omens prevented
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg328" id="pg328">328</a></span>
      the pageants from passing, or if the occasion of the show was
      scarce deemed worthy its celebration, these Precise stood a
      chance of being ill-treated by the spectators. A prefatory
      introduction to a work like this can hope little better usage
      from the public than they had. It proclaims the approach of what
      has often passed by before; adorned most certainly with greater
      splendour, perhaps conducted with greater regularity and skill.
      Yet will I not despair of giving at least a momentary amusement
      to my countrymen in general; while their entertainment shall
      serve as a vehicle for conveying expressions of particular
      kindness to those foreign individuals, whose tenderness softened
      the sorrows of absence, and who eagerly endeavoured by unmerited
      attentions to supply the loss of their company, on whom nature
      and habit had given me stronger claims."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Preface concludes with the happy remark that&mdash;"the
      labours of the press resemble those of the toilette: both should
      be attended to and finished with care; but once completed, should
      take up no more of our attention, unless we are disposed at
      evening to destroy all effect of our morning's study."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to name a book of travels in which
      anecdotes, observations, and reflections are more agreeably
      mingled, or one from which a clearer bird's-eye view of the
      external state of countries visited in rapid succession may be
      caught. I can only spare room for a few short extracts:

      black handkerchief about her neck, and a flat silver ring on her
      finger, like our ale-wives; a <i>femme publique</i>, dressed
      avowedly for the purposes of alluring the men, with a not very

      "I have stolen a day to visit my old acquaintance the English
      Austin Nuns at the Foffèe, and found the whole community alive
      and cheerful; they are many of them agreeable women, and having
      seen Dr. Johnson with me when I was last abroad, inquired much
      for him: Mrs, Fermor, the Prioress, niece to Belinda in the Rape
      of the Lock, taking occasion to tell me, comically enough, 'that
      she believed there was but little comfort to be found in a house
      that harboured <i>poets</i>; for that she remembered Mr. Pope's
      praise made her aunt very troublesome and conceited, while his
      numberless caprices would have employed ten servants to wait on
      him; and he gave one,' (said she) 'no amends by his talk neither,
      for he only sate dozing all day, when the sweet wine was out, and
      made his verses chiefly in the night; during which season he kept
      himself awake by drinking coffee, which it was one of the maids'
      business to make for him, and they took it by turns.'"

    <p>
      At Milan she institutes a delicate inquiry: "The women are not
      behind-hand in openness of confidence and comical sincerity. We
      have all heard much of Italian cicisbeism; I had a mind to know
      how matters really stood; and took the nearest way to information
      by asking a mighty beautiful and apparently artless young
      creature, <i>not noble</i>, how that affair was managed, for
      there is no harm done <i>I am sure</i>, said I: 'Why no,' replied
      she, 'no great <i>harm</i> to be sure: except wearisome
      attentions from a man one cares little about; for my own part,'
      continued she, 'I detest the custom, as I happen to love my
      husband excessively, and desire nobody's company in the world but
      his. We are not <i>people of fashion</i> though you know, nor at
      all rich; so how should we set fashions for our betters? They
      would only say, see how jealous he is! if <i>Mr. Such-a-one</i>
      sat much with me at home, or went with me to the Corso; and I
      <i>must</i> go with some gentleman you know: and the men are such
      ungenerous creatures, and have such ways with them: I want money
      often, and this <i>cavaliere servente</i> pays the bills, and so
      the connection draws closer&mdash;<i>that's all</i>.' And your
      husband! said I&mdash;'Oh, why he likes to see me well dressed;
      he is very good-natured, and very charming; I love him to my

      "This firmly-fixed idea of subordination (which I once heard a

      "Here were two men taken up last week, one for murdering his
      fellow-servant in cold blood, while the undefended creature had
      the lemonade tray in his hand going in to serve company; the
      other for breaking the new lamps lately set up with intention to
      light this town in the manner of the streets at Paris. 'I hope,'
      said I, 'that they will hang the murderer.' 'I rather hope,'
      replied a very sensible lady who sate near me, 'that they will
      hang the person who broke the lamps: for,' added she, 'the first
      committed his crime only out of revenge, poor fellow!! because
      the other had got his mistress from him by treachery; but this
      creature has had the impudence to break our fine new lamps, all
      for the sake of spiting <i>the Arch-duke!!</i>' The Arch-duke
      meantime hangs nobody at all; but sets his prisoners <span class=

      still, they are not punished for it when they do." ...

      The lover sacrificing his reputation, his liberty, or his life,
      to save the fair fame of his mistress, is not an unusual event in
      fiction, whatever it may be in real life. Balzac, Charles de
      Bernard, and M. de Jarnac have each made a self-sacrifice of this
      kind the basis of a romance. But neither of them has hit upon a
      better plot than might be formed out of the following Venetian
      story:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some years ago then, perhaps a hundred, one of the many spies
      who ply this town by night, ran to the state inquisitor, with
      information that such a nobleman (naming him) had connections
      with the French ambassador, and went privately to his house every
      night at a certain hour. The <i>messergrando</i>, as they call
      him, could not believe, nor would proceed, without better and
      stronger proof, against a man for whom he had an intimate
      personal friendship, and on whose virtue he counted with very
      particular reliance. Another spy was therefore set, and brought
      back the same intelligence, adding the description of his
      disguise: on which the worthy magistrate put on his mask and
      bauta, and went out himself; when his eyes confirming the report
      of his informants, and the reflection on his duty stifling all
      remorse, he sent publicly for <i>Foscarini</i> in the morning,
      whom the populace attended all weeping to his door. <span class=

      be forced from the firm-minded citizen, who, sensible of the
      discovery, prepared for that punishment he knew to be inevitable,
      and submitted to the fate his friend was obliged to inflict: no
      less than a dungeon for life, that dungeon so horrible that I
      have heard Mr. Howard was not permitted to see it.

      "The people lamented, but their lamentations were vain. The
      magistrate who condemned him never recovered the shock: but
      Foscarini was heard of no more, till an old lady died forty years
      after in Paris, whose last confession declared she was visited
      with amorous intentions by a nobleman of Venice whose name she
      never knew, while she resided there as companion to the
      ambassadress. So was Foscarini lost! so died he a martyr to love,
      and tenderness for female reputation!"

      The Mendicanti was a Venetian institution which deserves to be
      commemorated for its singularity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apropos to singing;&mdash;we were this evening carried to a
      well-known conservatory called the Mendicanti, who performed an
      oratorio in the church with great, and I dare say deserved
      applause. It was difficult for me to persuade myself that all the
      performers were women, till, watching carefully, our eyes
      convinced us, as they were but slightly grated. The sight of
      girls, however, handling the double bass, and blowing into the
      bassoon, did not much please <i>me</i>; and the deep-toned voice
      of her who sung the part of Saul seemed an odd unnatural thing
      enough. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg334" id=

      "Well! these pretty sirens were delighted to seize upon us, and
      pressed our visit to their parlour with a sweetness that I know
      not who would have resisted. We had no such intent; and amply did
      their performance repay my curiosity for visiting Venetian
      beauties, so justly celebrated for their seducing manners and
      soft address. They accompanied their voices with the forte-piano,
      and sung a thousand buffo songs, with all that gay voluptuousness
      for which their country is renowned.

    <p>
      "The school, however, is running to ruin apace; and perhaps the
      conduct of the married women here may contribute to make such
      <i>conservatorios</i> useless and neglected. When the Duchess of
      Montespan asked the famous Louison D'Arquien, by way of insult,
      as she pressed too near her, '<i>Comment alloit le metier</i>?'
      '<i>Depuis que les dames s'en mèlent</i>,' (replied the courtesan
      with no improper spirit,) '<i>il ne vaut plus rien</i>.'"

      Describing Florence, she says:&mdash;

      "Sir Horace Mann is sick and old; but there are conversations at

      we have been almost always asked."

      So much for Walpole's assertion that "she had broken with his
      Horace, because he could not invite her husband with the Italian
      nobility." She held her own, if she did not take the lead, in
      whatever society she happened to be thrown, and no one could have
      objected to Piozzi without breaking with her. In point of fact,
      no one did object to him. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg335"

      One of her notes on Naples is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well! if the Neapolitans do bury Christians like dogs,
      they make some singular compensations we will confess, by nursing
      dogs like Christians. A very veracious man informed me yester
      morning, that his poor wife was half broken-hearted at hearing
      such a Countess's dog was run over; 'for,' said he, 'having
      suckled the pretty creature herself, she loved it like one of her
      children.' I bid him repeat the circumstance, that no mistake
      might be made: he did so; but seeing me look shocked, or ashamed,
      or something he did not like,&mdash;'Why, Madam,' said the
      fellow, 'it is a common thing enough for ordinary men's wives to
      suckle the lap-dogs of ladies of quality:' adding, that they were
      paid for their milk, and he saw no harm in gratifying one's
      <i>superiors</i>. As I was disposed to see nothing <i>but</i>
      harm in disputing with such a competitor, our conference finished
      soon; but the fact is certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the margin she has written:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Greathead could scarcely be made to credit so hideous a
      fact, till I showed her the portrait (at a broker's shop) of a
      woman <i>suckling a cat</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cornelia Knight says: "Mr. and Mrs. Piozzi passed the winter at
      Naples and gave little concerts. He played with great taste on
      the pianoforte, and used to carry about a miniature one in his
      carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst discussing the propriety of complying with the customs of
      the country, she relates:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Dr. Goldsmith said once&mdash;'I would advise <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg336" id="pg336">336</a></span> every young
      fellow setting out in life <i>to love gravy</i>:'&mdash;and
      added, that he had formerly seen a glutton's eldest nephew
      disinherited, because his uncle never could persuade him to say
      he liked gravy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Forster thinks that the concluding anecdote conveys a false
      impression of one
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Who wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Piozzi, in her travels, quite solemnly sets forth that poor
      Dr. Goldsmith said once, 'I would advise every young fellow
      setting forth in life to love gravy,' alleging for it the serious
      reason that 'he had formerly seen a glutton's eldest nephew
      disinherited because his uncle never could persuade him to say he
      liked gravy.' Imagine the dullness that would convert a jocose
      saying of this kind into an unconscious utterance of grave
      absurdity."<span class="fnref">[1]</span> In his index may be
      read: "Mrs. Piozzi's absurd instance of Goldsmith's absurdity."
      Mrs. Piozzi does not quote the saying as an instance of
      absurdity; nor set it forth solemnly. She repeats it, as an
      illustration of her argument, in the same semi-serious spirit in
      which it was originally hazarded. Sydney Smith took a different
      view of this grave gravy question. On a young lady's declining
      gravy, he exclaimed: "I have been looking all my life for a
      person who, on principle, rejected gravy: let us vow eternal
      friendship."

      The "British Synonymy" appeared in 1794. It was thus assailed by
      Gifford:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though 'no one better knows his own house' than I the vanity of
      this woman; yet the idea of her undertaking such a work had never
      entered my head; and I was thunderstruck when I first saw it
      announced. To execute it with any tolerable degree of success,
      required a rare combination of talents, among the least of which
      may be numbered neatness of style, acuteness of perception, and a
      more than common accuracy of discrimination; and Mrs. Piozzi
      brought to the task, a jargon long since become proverbial for
      its vulgarity, an utter incapability of defining a single term in
      the language, and just as much Latin from a child's Syntax, as
      sufficed to expose the ignorance she so anxiously labours to
      conceal. 'If such a one be fit to write on Synonimes, speak.'
      Pignotti himself laughs in his sleeve; and his countrymen, long
      since undeceived, prize the lady's talents at their true worth,

      Other critics have been more lenient or more just. Enough
      philosophical knowledge and acuteness were discovered in the work
      to originate a rumour that she had retained some of the great
      lexicographer's manuscripts, or derived a posthumous advantage,
      in some shape, from her former intimacy with him. In "Thraliana,"
      Denbigh, 2nd January, 1795, she writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My 'Synonimes' have been reviewed at last. The <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg338" id="pg338">338</a></span> critics are
      all civil for aught I see, and nearly just, except when they say
      that Johnson left some fragments of a work upon Synonymy: of
      which God knows I never heard till now one syllable; never had he
      and I, in all the time we lived together, any conversation upon
      the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Walpole admits that it has some marked and peculiar merits,
      although its value consists rather in the illustrative matter,
      than in the definitions and etymologies. Thus, in distinguishing
      between <i>lavish</i>, <i>profuse</i> and <i>prodigal</i>, she
      relates:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two gentlemen were walking leisurely up the Hay-Market some time
      in the year 1749, lamenting the fate of the famous Cuzzona, an
      actress who some time before had been in high vogue, but was then
      as they heard in a very pitiable situation. 'Let us go and visit
      her,' said one of them, 'she lives but over the way.' The other
      consented; and calling at the door, they were shown up stairs,
      but found the faded beauty dull and spiritless, unable or
      unwilling to converse on any subject. 'How's this?' cried one of
      her consolers, 'are you ill? or is it but low spirits chains your
      tongue so?'&mdash;'Neither,' replied she: ''tis hunger I suppose.
      I ate nothing yesterday, and now 'tis past six o'clock, and not
      one penny have I in the world to buy me any food.'&mdash;'Come
      with us instantly to a tavern; we will treat you with the best
      roast fowls and Port wine that London can produce.'&mdash;'But I
      will have neither my dinner nor my place of eating it prescribed
      to <i>me</i>,' answered Cuzzona, in a sharper tone, 'else I need
      never have wanted.' 'Forgive <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg339" id="pg339">339</a></span> me,' cries the friend; 'do your
      own way; but eat in the name of God, and restore fainting
      nature.'&mdash;She thanked him then; and, calling to her a
      friendly wretch who inhabited the same theatre of misery, gave
      <i>him</i> the guinea the visitor accompanied his last words
      with; 'and run with this money,' said she, 'to such a
      wine-merchant,' (naming him); 'he is the only one keeps good
      Tokay by him. 'Tis a guinea a bottle, mind you,' to the boy; 'and
      bid the gentleman you buy it of give you a loaf into the
      bargain,&mdash;he won't refuse.' In half an hour or less the lad
      returned with the Tokay. 'But where,' cries Cuzzona, 'is the loaf
      I spoke for?' 'The merchant would give me no loaf,' replies her
      messenger; 'he drove me from the door, and asked if I took him
      for a baker.' 'Blockhead!' exclaims she; 'why I must have bread
      to my wine, you know, and I have not a penny to purchase any. Go
      beg me a loaf directly.' The fellow returns once more with one in
      his hand and a halfpenny, telling 'em the gentleman threw him
      three, and laughed at his impudence. She gave her Mercury the
      money, broke the bread into a wash-hand basin which stood near,
      poured the Tokay over it, and devoured the whole with eagerness.
      This was indeed a heroine in PROFUSION. Some active well-wishers
      procured her a benefit after this; she gained about 350<i>l</i>.,
      'tis said, and laid out two hundred of the money instantly in a
      <i>shell-cap</i>. They wore such things then."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Savage got a guinea, he commonly spent it in a tavern at a
      sitting; and referring to the memorable <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg340" id="pg340">340</a></span> morning when
      the "Vicar of Wakefield" was produced, Johnson says: "I sent him
      (Goldsmith) a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I
      accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his
      landlady had arrested him for his rent. I perceived that he had
      already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a
      glass before him." Mrs. Piozzi continues:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Doctor Johnson had always some story at hand to check
      extravagant and wanton wastefulness. His improviso verses made on
      a young heir's coming of age are highly capable of restraining
      such folly, if it is to be restrained: they never yet were
      printed, I believe.

      No date, but previous to 25th May, 1791.&mdash;"I have been now
      laughing and crying by turns, for two days, over Boswell's book.

      ... he is quite light-headed, yet madmen, drunkards, and fools

      "<i>25th May</i>, 1791.&mdash;The death of my son, so suddenly,

      all these fellows of wishing we may know one another in the next

      reproaches for breach of confidence and cruel usage. Sure, sure I
      hope, rancour and resentment will at least be put off in the last

      In 1801, Mrs. Piozzi published "Retrospection; or a Review of the
      Most Striking and Important Events, Characters, Situations, and
      their Consequences, which the Last Eighteen Hundred Years have
      presented to the View of Mankind." It is in two volumes quarto,
      containing rather more than 1000 pages. A fitting motto for it
      would have been <i>De omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis.</i> The
      subject, or range of subjects, was beyond her grasp; and the best
      that can be said of the book is that a good general impression of
      the stream of history, lighted up with some striking traits of
      manners and character, may be obtained from it. It would have
      required the united powers and acquirements of Raleigh, Burke,
      Gibbon, and Voltaire to fill so vast a canvass with appropriate
      groups and figures; and she is more open to blame for the
      ambitious conception of the work than for her comparative failure
      in the execution. In 1799 she writes to Dr. Gray: "The truth is,
      my plans stretch too far for these times, or for my own age; but
      the wish, though scarce hope, of my heart, is to finish the work
      I am engaged in, get you to look it over for me, and print in
      March 1801." She published it in January 1801, but it was not
      looked over by her learned correspondent. Some slight misgiving
      is betrayed in the Preface:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I should have made improper choice of facts, and if I should
      be found at length most to resemble Maister Fabyan of old, who
      writing the life of Henry V. lays heaviest stress on a new
      weathercock set-up on St. Paul's steeple during that eventful
      reign, my book <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg344" id=
      "pg344">344</a></span> must share the fate of his, and be like
      that forgotten: reminding before its death perhaps a friend or
      two of a poor man (Macbean) living in later times, that Doctor
      Johnson used to tell us of; who being advised to take
      subscriptions for a new Geographical Dictionary, hastened to Bolt
      Court and begged advice. There having listened carefully for
      half-an-hour, 'Ah, but dear Sir,' exclaimed the admiring
      parasite, 'if I am to make all this eloquent ado about Athens and
      Rome, where shall we find place, do you think, for Richmond, or
      Aix La Chapelle?'"
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      Writing from Bath, December 15th, 1802, she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 'Gentleman's Magazine' for July 1801 contained my answer to
      such critics as confined themselves to faults I could have helped
      committing&mdash;had they been faults. Those who merely told
      disagreeable truths concerning my person, or dress, or age, or
      such stuff, expected, of course, no reply. There are innumerable
      press errors in the book, from my being obliged to print on new
      year's day&mdash;during an insurrection of the printers. These
      the 'Critical Review' laid hold of with an acuteness sharpened by
      malignity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Moore, who was staying at Bowood, sets down in his diary for
      April, 1823: "Lord L. in the evening, quoted a ridiculous passage
      from the Preface to Mrs. Piozzi's 'Retrospections,' in which,
      anticipating the ultimate perfection of the human race, she says
      she does not despair of the time arriving when 'Vice will take
      refuge in the arms of impossibility.' Mentioned also an ode of
      hers to Posterity, beginning, 'Posterity, <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg345" id="pg345">345</a></span> gregarious
      dame,' the only meaning of which must be, a lady <i>chez qui</i>
      numbers assemble&mdash;a lady at <i>home</i>."<span class=

        [1] Memoirs, &amp;c., vol. iv. p. 38.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      There is no such passage in the Preface to "Retrospection," and
      the ode is her "Ode to Society," who is not improperly addressed
      as "gregarious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeated," adds Moore, "what Jekyll told the other day of
      Bearcroft saying to Mrs. Piozzi, when Thrale, after she had
      repeatedly called him Mr. Beercraft: 'Beercraft is not my name,
      Madam; it may be your trade, but it is not my name.'" It may
      always be questioned whether this offensive description of
      repartee was really uttered at the time. But Bearcroft was
      capable of it. He began his cross-examination of Mr. Vansittart
      by&mdash;"With your leave, Sir, I will call you Mr. Van for
      shortness." "As you please, Sir, and I will call you Mr. Bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of 1795, Mrs. Piozzi left Streatham for her seat
      in North Wales, where (1800 or 1801) she was visited by a young
      nobleman, now an eminent statesman, distinguished by his love of
      literature and the fine arts, who has been good enough to recall
      and write down his impressions of her for me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did certainly know Madame Piozzi, but had no habits of
      acquaintance with her, and she never lived in London to my
      knowledge. When in my youth I made a tour in Wales&mdash;times
      when all inns were bad, and all houses hospitable&mdash;I put up
      for a day at her house, I <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg346"
      id="pg346">346</a></span> think in Denbighshire, the proper name
      of which was Bryn, and to which, on the occasion of her marriage
      I was told, she had recently added the name of Bella. I remember
      her taking me into her bed-room to show me the floor covered with
      folios, quartos, and octavos, for consultation, and indicating
      the labour she had gone through in compiling an immense volume
      she was then publishing, called 'Retrospection.' She was
      certainly what was called, and is still called, blue, and that of
      a deep tint, but good humoured and lively, though affected; her
      husband, a quiet civil man, with his head full of nothing but
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I afterwards called on her at Bath, where she chiefly resided. I
      remember it was at the time Madame de Staël's 'Delphine,' and
      'Corinne,' came out<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and that we
      agreed in preferring 'Delphine,' which nobody reads now, to
      'Corinne,' which most people read then, and a few do still. She
      rather avoided talking of Johnson. These are trifles, not worth
      recording, but I have put them down that you might not think me
      neglectful of your wishes; but now <i>j'ai vuidé mon sac</i>."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "Delphine" appeared in 1804; "Corinne," in 1806.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Her mode of passing her time when she had ceased writing books,
      with the topics which interested her, will be best learned from
      her letters. Her vivacity never left her, and the elasticity of
      her spirits bore up against every kind of depression. A lady who
      met her on her way to Wynnstay in January, 1803, describes her as
      "skipping about like a kid, quite <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg347" id="pg347">347</a></span> a figure of fun, in a tiger
      skin shawl, lined with scarlet, and <i>only</i> five colours upon
      her head-dress&mdash;on the top of a flaxen wig a bandeau of blue
      velvet, a bit of tiger ribbon, a white beaver hat and plume of
      black feathers&mdash;as gay as a lark."
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      In a letter, dated Jan. 1799, to a Welsh neighbour, Mrs. Piozzi
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Piozzi has lost considerably in purse, by the cruel inroads
      of the French in Italy, and of all his family driven from their
      quiet homes, has at length with difficulty saved one little boy
      who is now just turned of five years old. We have got him here
      (Bath) since I wrote last, and his uncle will take him to school
      next week; for as our John has nothing but his talents and
      education to depend upon, he must be a scholar, and we will try
      hard to make him a very good one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor little boy from Lombardy said as I walked him across our
      market, 'These are sheeps' heads, are they not, aunt? I saw a
      basket of men's heads at Brescia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As he was by a lucky chance baptized, in compliment to me, John
      Salusbury, five years ago, when happier days smiled on his
      family, he will be known in England by no other, and it will be
      forgotten he is a foreigner. A lucky circumstance for one who is
      intended to work his way among our islanders by talent,
      diligence, and education."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thus mentions this event in "Thraliana," January 17th, 1798:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Italy is ruined and England threatened. I have sent for one
      little boy from among my husband's <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg348" id="pg348">348</a></span> nephews. He was christened John
      Salusbury: he shall be naturalised, and then we will see whether
      he will be more grateful and natural and comfortable than Miss
      Thrales have been to the mother they have at length driven to
      desperation."
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly have denied her husband the satisfaction of
      rescuing a single member of his family from the wreck; and they
      were bound to provide handsomely for the child of their adoption.
      Whether she carried the sentiment too far in giving him the
      entire estate (not a large one) is a very different question; on
      which she enters fearlessly in one of the fragments of the
      Autobiography. In a marginal note on one of the printed letters
      in which Johnson writes: "Mrs. Davenant says you regain your
      health,"&mdash;she remarks: "Mrs. Davenant neither knew nor
      cared, as she wanted her brother Harry Cotton to marry Lady
      Keith, and I offered my estate with her. Miss Thrale said she
      wished to have nothing to do either with my family or my fortune.
      They were all cruel and all insulting." Her fits of irritation
      and despondency never lasted long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mode of bringing up her adopted nephew was more in accordance
      with her ultimate liberality, than with her early intentions or
      professions of teaching him to "work his way among our
      islanders." Instead of suffering him to travel to and from the
      University by coach, she insisted on his travelling post; and she
      is said to have remarked to the mother of a Welsh baronet, who
      was similarly anxious for the comfort and <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg349" id="pg349">349</a></span> dignity of
      her heir, "Other people's children are baked in coarse common pie
      dishes, ours in patty-pans."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was misreported, or afterwards improved upon the thought;
      for, in June 1810, she writes to Dr. Gray: "He is a boy of
      excellent principle. Education at a private school has an effect
      like baking loaves in a tin. The bread is more insipid, but it
      comes out <i>clean</i>; and Mr. Gray laughed, when at breakfast
      this morning, our undercrusts suggested the comparison."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Conway Notes, she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had we vexations enough? We had certainly many pleasures. The
      house in Wales was beautiful, and the Boy was beautiful too. Mr.
      Piozzi said I had spoiled my own children and was spoiling his.
      My reply was, that I loved spoiling people, and hated any one I
      could not spoil. Am I not now trying to spoil dear Mr. Conway?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When she talks of spoiling, she must not be understood literally.
      In 1817 she writes from Bath to Dr. Gray:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir John and Lady Salusbury staid with me six or seven weeks,
      and made themselves most beloved among us. They are very good
      young creatures.... My children read your <i>Key</i> to each
      other on Sunday noons: the <i>Connection</i> on Sunday nights.
      You remember me hoping and proposing to make dear Salusbury a
      gentleman, a Christian, and a scholar; and when one has succeeded
      in the first two wishes, there is no need to fret if the third
      does fail a <i>little</i>. Such is my situation concerning my
      <i>adopted</i>, as you are accustomed to call him." <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg350" id="pg350">350</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she died she had the satisfaction of seeing him sheriff of
      his county; and on carrying up an address, he was knighted and
      became Sir John Salusbury Piozzi Salusbury. Miss Williams Wynn
      has preserved a somewhat apocryphal anecdote of his
      disinterestedness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I read her (Mrs. P.'s) lamentations over her poverty, I
      could not help believing that Sir J. Salusbury had proved
      ungrateful to his benefactress. For the honour of human nature I
      rejoice to find this is not the case. When he made known to his
      aunt his wish to marry, she promised to make over to him the
      property of Brynbella. Even before the marriage was concluded she
      had distressed herself by her lavish expenditure at Streatham. I
      saw by the letters that Gillow's bill amounted to near
      2,400<i>l</i>., and Mr. (the late Sir John) Williams tells me she
      had continually very large parties from London. Sir John
      Salusbury then came to her, offered to relinquish all her
      promised gifts and the dearest wish of his heart, saying he
      should be most grateful to her if she would only give him a
      commission in the army, and let him seek his fortune. At the same
      time he added that he made this offer because all was still in
      his power, but that from the moment he married, she must be aware
      that it would be no longer so, that he should not feel himself
      justified in bringing a wife into distress of circumstances, nor
      in entailing poverty on children unborn.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> She refused; he married; and she went on in
      her <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg351" id=
      "pg351">351</a></span> course of extravagance. She had left
      herself a life income only, and large as it was, no tradesman
      would wait a reasonable time for payment; she was nearly eighty;
      and they knew that at her death nothing would be left to pay her
      debts, and so they seized the goods."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] If the estate was settled in the usual manner, he would
        have only a life estate; and I believe it was so settled.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When Fielding, the novelist, rather boastingly avowed that he
      never knew, and believed he never should know, the difference
      between a shilling and sixpence, he was told: "Yes, the time will
      come when you will know it&mdash;when you have only eighteen
      pence left." If the author of "Tom Jones" could not be taught the
      value of money, we must not be too hard on Mrs. Piozzi for not
      learning it, after lesson upon lesson in the hard school of
      "impecuniosity." Whilst Piozzi lived, her affairs were faithfully
      and carefully administered. Although they built Brynbella, spent
      a good deal of money on Streatham, and lived handsomely, they
      never wanted money. He had a moderate fortune, the produce of his
      professional labours, and left it, neither impaired nor
      materially increased, to his family. With peculiar reference
      probably to her habits of profuse expenditure, he used to say
      that "white monies were good for ladies, yellow for gentlemen."
      He took the guineas under his especial charge, leaving only the
      silver to her. This was a matter of notoriety in the
      neighbourhood, and the tenants, to please her or humour the joke,
      sometimes brought bags of shillings and sixpences in part payment
      of their rents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Conway Notes she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our head-quarters were in Wales, where dear Piozzi <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg352" id="pg352">352</a></span> repaired my
      church, built a new vault for my old ancestors, chose the place
      in it where he and I are to repose together.... He lived some
      twenty-five years with me, however, but so punished with gout
      that we found Bath the best wintering-place for many, many
      seasons.&mdash;Mrs. Siddons' last appearance there he witnessed,
      when she played Calista to Dimond's Lothario, in which he looked
      <i>so</i> like Garrick, it shocked us <i>all three</i>, I
      believe; for Garrick adored Mr. Piozzi, and Siddons hated the
      little great man to her heart. Poor Dimond! he was a well-bred,
      pleasing, worthy creature, and did the honours of his own house
      and table with peculiar grace indeed. No likeness in private life
      or manner,&mdash;none at all; no wit, no fun, no frolic humour
      had Mr. Dimond:&mdash;no grace, no dignity, no real unaffected
      elegance of mien or behaviour had his predecessor,
      David,&mdash;whose partiality to my fastidious husband was for
      that reason never returned. Merriment, difficult for <i>him</i>
      to comprehend, made no amends for the want of that which no one
      understood better,&mdash;so he hated all the wits but Murphy."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is hardly a family of note or standing within visiting
      distance of their place, that has not some tradition or
      reminiscence to relate concerning them; and all agree in
      describing him as a worthy good sort of man, obliging,
      inoffensive, kind to the poor, principally remarkable for his
      devotion to music, and utterly unable to his dying day to
      familiarise himself with the English language or manners. It is
      told of him that being required to pay a turnpike toll near the
      house of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg353" id=
      "pg353">353</a></span> country neighbour whom he was on his way
      to visit, he took it for granted that the toll went into his
      neighbour's pocket, and proposed setting up a gate near Brynbella
      with the view of levying toll in his turn.
    </p>
    <p class="break">
      In September, 1800, she wrote from Brynbella to Dr. Gray:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mr. Piozzi, who takes men out of misery so far as his power
      extends in this neighbourhood, feels flattered and encouraged by
      your very kind approbation. He has been getting rugs for the
      cottagers' beds to keep them warm this winter, while we are away,
      and they all take me into their sleeping rooms when I visit them
      <i>now</i>, to show how comfortably they live. As for the old hut
      you so justly abhorred, and so kindly noticed&mdash;it is knocked
      down and its coarse name too, Potlicko: we call it
      Cottage-o'-the-Park. Some recurrence to the original derivation
      in soup season will not, however, be much amiss I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amongst the company," says Moore, "was Mrs. John Kemble. She
      mentioned an anecdote of Piozzi, who upon calling upon some old
      lady of quality, was told by the servant, she was 'indifferent.'
      'Is she indeed?' answered Piozzi, huffishly, 'then pray tell her
      I can be as indifferent as she;' and walked away."<span class=

      Till he was disabled by the gout, his principal occupation was
      his violin, and it was her delight to listen to him. She more
      than once observed to the vicar, "Such music is quite heavenly."
      "I am in despair," <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg354" id=
      "pg354">354</a></span> cried out the village fiddler, "I may now
      stick my fiddle in my thatched roof, for a greater performer is
      come to reside in the parish." The existing superstition of the
      country is that his spirit, playing on his favourite instrument,
      still haunts one wing of Brynbella. If he designed the building,
      his architectural taste does not merit the praises she lavishes
      on it. The exterior is not prepossessing; but there is a look of
      comfort about the house; the interior is well arranged: the
      situation, which commands a fine and extensive view of the upper
      part of the valley of the Clywd, is admirably chosen; the garden
      and grounds are well laid out; and the walks through the woods on
      either side, especially one called the Lovers' Walk, are
      remarkably picturesque. Altogether, Brynbella may be fairly held
      to merit the appellation of a "pretty villa." The name implies a
      compliment to Piozzi's country as well as to his taste; for she
      meant it to typify the union between Wales and Italy in his and
      her own proper persons. She says in the Conway Notes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Piozzi built the house for me, he said; my own old chateau,
      Bachygraig by name, tho' very curious, was wholly uninhabitable;
      and we called the Italian villa he set up as mine in the Vale of
      Cluid, Brynbella, or the beautiful brow, making the name half
      Welsh and half Italian, as <i>we</i> were."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Burney, in a letter to his daughter, thus described the
      position and feelings of the couple towards each other in 1808:
    </p>
    <p>
      "During my invalidity at Bath I had an unexpected <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg355" id="pg355">355</a></span> visit from
      your Streatham friend, of whom I had lost sight for more than ten
      years. She still looks very well, but is graver, and candour
      itself; though she still says good things, and writes admirable
      notes and letters, I am told, to my granddaughters C. and M., of
      whom she is very fond. We shook hands very cordially, and avoided
      any allusion to our long separation and its cause. The <i>caro
      sposo</i> still lives, but is such an object from the gout, that
      the account of his sufferings made me pity him sincerely; he
      wished, she told me, 'to see his old and worthy friend,' and
      <i>un beau matin</i> I could not refuse compliance with his wish.
      She nurses him with great affection and tenderness, never goes
      out or has company when he is in pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Conway Notes she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Piozzi's fine hand upon the organ and pianoforte deserted him.
      Gout, such as I never knew, fastened on his fingers, distorting
      them into every dreadful shape.... A little girl, shown to him as
      a musical wonder of five years old, said, 'Pray, Sir, why are
      your fingers wrapped up in black silk so?' 'My dear,' replied he,
      'they are in mourning for my voice.' 'Oh, me!' cries the child,
      '<i>is she dead?</i>' He sung an easy song, and the baby
      exclaimed, 'Ah, Sir! you are very naughty&mdash;you tell fibs!'
      Poor dears! and both gone now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When life was gradually, but perceptibly, closing round him at
      Bath, in 1808, I asked him if he would wish to converse with a
      Romish priest,&mdash;we had full opportunity there. 'By no
      means,' said he. 'Call <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg356" id=
      "pg356">356</a></span> Mr. Leman of the Crescent.' We did
      so,&mdash;poor Bessy ran and fetched him. Mr. Piozzi received the
      blessed Sacrament at his hands; but recovered sufficiently to go
      home and die in his own house."
    </p>
    <p>
      He died of gout at Brynbella in March 1809, and was buried in a
      vault constructed by her desire in Dymerchion Church. There is a
      portrait of him (period and painter unknown) still preserved
      amongst the family portraits at Brynbella. It is that of a
      good-looking man of about forty, in a straight-cut brown coat
      with metal buttons, lace frill and ruffles, and some leaves of
      music in his hand. There are also two likenesses of Mrs. Piozzi:
      one a three-quarter length (kit-kat), taken apparently when she
      was about forty; the other a miniature of her at an advanced age.
      Both confirm her description of herself as too strong-featured to
      be pretty. The hands in the three-quarter length are gloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brynbella continued her headquarters till 1814, when she gave it
      up to Sir John Salusbury. From that period she resided
      principally at Bath and Clifton, occasionally visiting Streatham
      or making summer trips to the seaside.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she and her eldest daughter should ever be again (if they
      ever were) on a perfect footing of confidence and affection, was
      a moral impossibility. Estrangements are commonly durable in
      proportion to the closeness of the tie that has been severed; and
      it is no more than natural that each party, yearning for a
      reconciliation and not knowing that the wish is reciprocated,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg357" id="pg357">357</a></span>
      should persevere in casting the blame of the prolonged coldness
      on the other. Occasional sarcasms no more prove disregard or
      indifference, than Swift's "only a woman's hair" implies contempt
      for the sex.

      Her way of life after Piozzi's death may be collected from the
      Letters, with the exception of one strange episode towards the
      end. When nearly eighty, she took a fancy for an actor named
      Conway, who came out on the London boards in 1813, and had the
      honour of acting Romeo and Jaffier to the Juliet and Belvidera of
      Miss O'Neill (Lady Becher). He also acted with her in Dean
      Milman's fine play, "Fazio." But it was his ill fate to reverse
      Churchill's famous lines:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        "Before such merits all objections fly,
      </p>
      <p>
        Pritchard's genteel, and Garrick's six feet high."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Conway was six feet high, and a very handsome man to boot; but
      his advantages were purely physical; not <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg358" id="pg358">358</a></span> a spark of
      genius animated his fine features and commanding figure, and he
      was battling for a moderate share of provincial celebrity, when
      Mrs. Piozzi fell in with him at Bath. It has been rumoured in
      Flintshire that she wished to marry him, and offered Sir John
      Salusbury a large sum in ready money (which she never possessed)
      to give up Brynbella (which he could not give up), that she might
      settle it on the new object of her affections. But none of the
      letters or documents that have fallen in my way afford even
      plausibility to the rumour, and some of the testamentary papers
      in which his name occurs, go far towards discrediting the belief
      that her attachment ever went beyond admiration and friendship
      expressed in exaggerated terms.<span class="fnref">[1]</span>

        [1] Since the appearance of the first edition of this work, it
        has been stated on the authority of a distinguished man of
        letters that Conway shewed the late Charles Mathews a letter
        from Mrs. Piozzi, offering marriage.&mdash;<i>New Monthly

      Conway threw himself overboard and was drowned in a voyage from
      New York to Charleston in 1828. His effects were sold at New
      York, and amongst them a copy of the folio edition of Young's
      "Night Thoughts," in which he had made a note of its having been
      presented to him by his "dearly attached friend, the celebrated
      Mrs. Piozzi." In the preface to "Love Letters of Mrs. Piozzi,
      Written when she was Eighty, to William Augustus Conway,"
      published in London in 1842, it is stated that the originals,
      seven in number, were purchased by an <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg359" id="pg359">359</a></span> American
      "lady," who permitted a "gentleman" to take copies and use them
      as he might think fit. What this "gentleman" thought fit, was to
      publish them with a catchpenny title and an alleged extract by
      way of motto to sanction it. The genuineness of the letters is
      doubtful, and the interpolation of three or four sentences would
      alter their entire tenor. But taken as they stand, their language
      is not warmer than an old woman of vivid fancy and sensibility
      might have deemed warranted by her age. "Tell Mr. Johnson I love
      him exceedingly," is the mission given by the old Countess of
      Eglinton to Boswell in 1778. <i>L'age n'a point de sexe</i>; and
      no one thought the worse of Madame Du Deffand for the impassioned
      tone in which she addressed Horace Walpole, whose dread of
      ridicule induced him to make a most ungrateful return to her
      fondness.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> Years before the
      formation of this acquaintance, Mrs. Piozzi had acquired the
      difficult art of growing old; <i>je sais vieillir</i>: she dwells
      frequently but naturally on her age: she contemplates the
      approach of death with firmness and without self-deception: and
      her elasticity of spirit never for a moment suggests the image of
      an antiquated coquette. Of the seven letters in question, the one
      cited as most compromising is the sixth, in which Conway is
      exhorted to bear patiently a rebuff he had just received from
      some younger beauty:
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">

      "'Tis not a year and a quarter since, dear Conway, accepting of

      <i>your lady</i> but retains her friendship: oh if I can but keep
      <i>her</i> patronage, I care not for the rest.' And now, when
      that friendship follows you through sickness and through sorrow;
      now that her patronage is daily rising in importance: upon a lock
      of hair given or refused by une petite Traitresse, hangs all the
      happiness of my once high-spirited and high-blooded friend. Let

      any <i>particular subject</i> too long, or too intensely. It is
      really very dangerous to the health of body and soul. Besides
      that our time here is but short; a mere preface to the great book
      of eternity: and 'tis scarce worthy of a reasonable being not to
      keep the end of human existence so far in view that we may tend

    <p>
      Conway's "high blood" was as great a recommendation to Mrs.
      Piozzi as his good looks, and he vindicated his claim to noble
      descent by his conduct, which was disinterested and gentlemanlike
      throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moore sets down in his Diary, April 28, 1819: "Breakfasted with
      the Fitzgeralds. Took me to call on Mrs. Piozzi; a wonderful old
      lady; faces of other times seemed to crowd over her as she
      sat,&mdash;the Johnsons, Reynoldses, &amp;c. &amp;c.: though
      turned eighty, she has all the quickness and intelligence of a
      gay young woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nichol, the bookseller, had said that "Johnson was the link that
      connected Shakespeare with the rest of mankind." On hearing this,
      Mrs. Piozzi at eighty exclaimed, "Oh, the dear fellow, I must
      give him a kiss for that idea." When Nichol told the story, he
      added, "I never got it, and she went out of the world a kiss in
      my debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most characteristic feats or freaks of this
      extraordinary woman was the celebration of her eightieth birthday
      by a concert, ball, and supper, to between six and seven hundred
      people, at the Kingston Rooms, Bath, on the 27th January, 1820.
      At the conclusion <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg362" id=
      "pg362">362</a></span> of the supper, her health was proposed by
      Admiral Sir James Sausmarez, and drunk with three times three.
      The dancing began at two, when she led off with her adopted son,
      Sir John Salusbury, dancing (according to the author of
      "Piozziana," an eye-witness) "with astonishing elasticity, and
      with all the true air of dignity which might have been expected
      of one of the best bred females in society." When fears were
      expressed that she had done too much, she replied:&mdash;"No:
      this sort of thing is greatly in the mind; and I am almost
      tempted to say the same of growing old at all, especially as it
      regards those of the usual concomitants of age, viz., laziness,
      defective sight, and ill-temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far from feeling fatigued or exhausted on the following day
      by her exertions," remarks Sir James Fellowes in a note on this
      event, "she amused us by her sallies of wit, and her jokes on
      'Tully's Offices,' of which her guests had so eagerly availed
      themselves.". Tully was the cook and confectioner, the Bath
      Gunter, who provided the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Piozzi died in May, 1821. Her death is circumstantially
      communicated in a letter from Mrs. Pennington, the lady mentioned
      in Miss Seward's correspondence as the beautiful and agreeable
      Sophia Weston:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="quotdate">
      "Hot Wells, May 5th, 1821.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Miss Willoughby,&mdash;It is my painful task to communicate
      to you, who have so lately been the kind associate of dearest
      Mrs. Piozzi, the irreparable loss we <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg363" id="pg363">363</a></span> have all
      sustained in that incomparable woman and beloved friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She closed her various life about nine o'clock on Wednesday,
      after an illness of ten days, with as little suffering as could
      be imagined under these awful circumstances. Her bed-side was
      surrounded by her weeping daughters: Lady Keith and Mrs. Hoare
      arrived in time to be fully recognised<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>; Miss Thrale, who was absent from town, only
      just before she expired, but with the satisfaction of seeing her
      breathe her last in peace.

    <p>
      "Nothing could behave with more tenderness and propriety than
      these ladies, whose conduct, I am convinced, has been much
      misrepresented and calumniated by those who have only attended to
      <i>one</i> side of the history: but may all that is past be now
      buried in oblivion! Retrospection seldom improves our view of any
      subject. Sir John Salusbury was too distant, the close of her
      illness being so rapid, for us to entertain any expectation of
      his arriving in time to see the dear deceased. He only reached
      Clifton late <i>last</i> night. I have not yet seen him; my whole
      time has been devoted to the afflicted ladies."

    <div class="footnote">

      Mrs. Pennington told a friend that Mrs. Piozzi's last words were:
      "I die in the trust and the fear of God." When she was attended
      by Sir George Gibbes, being unable to articulate, she traced a
      coffin in the air with her hands and lay calm. Her will, dated
      the 29th March, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg364" id=
      "pg364">364</a></span> 1816, makes Sir John Salusbury Piozzi
      Salusbury heir to all her real and personal property with the
      exception of some small bequests, Sir James Fellowes and Sir John
      Salusbury being appointed executors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Memorandum signed by Sir James Fellowes runs thus:&mdash;"After
      I had read the Will, Lady Keith and her two sisters present, said
      they had long been prepared for the contents and for such a
      disposition of the property, and they acknowledged the validity
      of the Will."
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In any endeavour to solve the difficult problem of Mrs. Piozzi's
      conduct and character, it should be kept in view that the highest
      testimony to her worth has been volunteered by those with whom
      she passed the last years of her life in the closest intimacy.
      She had become completely reconciled to Madame D'Arblay, with
      whom she was actively corresponding when she died, and her mixed
      qualities of head and heart are thus summed up in that lady's
      Diary, May, 1821:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lost now, just lost, my once most dear, intimate, and
      admired friend, Mrs. Thrale Piozzi, who preserved her fine
      faculties, her imagination, her intelligence, her powers of
      allusion and citation, her extraordinary memory, and her almost
      unexampled vivacity, to the last of her existence. She was in her
      eighty-second year, and yet owed not her death to age nor to
      natural decay, but to the effects of a fall in a journey from
      Penzance to Clifton. On her eightieth birthday she gave a great
      ball, concert, and supper, in the public <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg365" id="pg365">365</a></span> rooms at
      Bath, to upwards of two hundred persons, and the ball she opened
      herself. She was, in truth, a most wonderful character for
      talents and eccentricity, for wit, genius, generosity, spirit,
      and powers of entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She had a great deal both of good and not good, in common with
      Madame de Staël Holstein. They had the same sort of highly
      superior intellect, the same depth of learning, the same general
      acquaintance with science, the same ardent love of literature,
      the same thirst for universal knowledge, and the same buoyant
      animal spirits, such as neither sickness, sorrow, nor even
      terror, could subdue. Their conversation was equally luminous,
      from the sources of their own fertile minds, and from their
      splendid acquisitions from the works and acquirements of others.
      Both were zealous to serve, liberal to bestow, and graceful to
      oblige; and both were truly high-minded in prizing and praising
      whatever was admirable that came in their way. Neither of them
      was delicate nor polished, though each was flattering and
      caressing; but both had a fund inexhaustible of good humour, and
      of sportive gaiety, that made their intercourse with those they
      wished to please attractive, instructive, and delightful; and
      though not either of them had the smallest real malevolence in
      their compositions, neither of them could ever withstand the
      pleasure of uttering a repartee, let it wound whom it might, even
      though each would serve the very person they goaded with all the
      means in their power. Both were kind, charitable, and munificent,
      and therefore <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg366" id=
      "pg366">366</a></span> beloved; both were sarcastic, careless,
      and daring, and therefore feared. The morality of Madame de Staël
      was by far the most faulty, but so was the society to which she
      belonged; so were the general manners of those by whom she was
      encircled."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one real point of similarity between Madame de Staël and
      Mrs. Piozzi, which has been omitted in the parallel. Both were
      treated much in the same manner by the amiable, sensitive, and
      unsophisticated Fanny Burney. In Feb. 1793, she wrote to her
      father, then at Paris, to announce her intimacy with a small
      "colony" of distinguished emigrants settled at Richmond, the
      cynosure of which was the far-famed daughter of Necker. He writes
      to caution her on the strength of a suspicious <i>liaison</i>
      with M. de Narbonne. She replies by declaring her belief that the
      charge is a gross calumny. "Indeed, I think you could not spend a
      day with them and not see that their commerce is that of pure,
      but exalted and most elegant, friendship. I would, nevertheless,
      give the world to avoid being a guest under their roof, now that
      I have heard even the shadow of such a rumour."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Croker was right, she was then in her forty-second year;
      at all events, no tender, timid, delicate maiden, ready to start
      at a hint or semblance of impropriety; and she waved her scruples
      without hesitation when they stood in the way of her intercourse
      with M. D'Arblay, whom she married in July 1793, he being then
      employed in transcribing Madame de Staël's Essay on the Influence
      of the Passions. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg367" id=
      "pg367">367</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the parallel, with all due deference to Madame D'Arblay's
      proved sagacity aided by her personal knowledge of her two gifted
      friends, it may be suggested that they present fewer points of
      resemblance than any two women of at all corresponding
      celebrity.<span class="fnref">[1]</span> The superiority in the
      highest qualities of mind will be awarded without hesitation to
      the French woman, although M. Thiers terms her writings the
      perfection of mediocrity. She grappled successfully with some of
      the weightiest and subtlest questions of social and political
      science; in criticism she displayed powers which Schlegel might
      have envied while he aided their fullest development in her
      "Germany"; and her "Corinne" ranks amongst the best of those
      works of fiction which excel in description, reflection, and
      sentiment, rather than in pathos, fancy, stirring incident, or
      artfully contrived plot. But her tone of mind was so essentially
      and notoriously masculine, that when she asked Talleyrand whether
      he had read her "Delphine," he answered, "Non, Madame, mais on
      m'a dit que-nous y sommes tous les deux déguisés en
      femmes."<span class="fnref">[2]</span> This was a material
      drawback on her agreeability: in a moment of excited
      consciousness, she exclaimed, that she would give all her fame
      for the power of fascinating; <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg368" id="pg368">368</a></span> and there was no lack of
      bitterness in her celebrated repartee to the man who, seated
      between her and Madame Recamier, boasted of being between Wit and
      Beauty, "Oui, et sans posséder ni l'un ni l'autre."<span class=
      "fnref">[3]</span> The view from Richmond Park she called "calme
      et animée, ce qu'on doit être, et que je ne suis pas."

        <i>notables</i> fresh from his province was teased by two
        <i>petits maîtres</i> to tell them who he was. "Eh bien donc,
        le voici: je suis ni sot ni fat, mais je suis entre les
        deux."&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Hannah More</i>, vol. ii. p. 57.

      In London she was soon voted a bore by the wits and people of
      fashion. She thought of convincing whilst they thought of dining.
      Sheridan and Brummell delighted in mystifying her. Byron
      complained that she was always talking of himself or
      herself<span class="fnref">[1]</span>, and concludes his account
      of a dinner-party by the remark:&mdash;"But we got up too soon
      after the women; and Mrs. Corinne always lingers so long after
      dinner, that we wish her&mdash;in the drawing-room." In another
      place he says: "I saw Curran presented to Madame de Staël at
      Mackintosh's; it was the grand confluence between the Rhone and
      the Saône, and they were both so d&mdash;d ugly that I could not
      help wondering how the best intellects of France and England
      could have taken up respectively such residences." He afterwards
      qualifies this opinion: "Her figure was not bad; her legs
      tolerable; her arms good: altogether I can conceive her having
      been a desirable <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg369" id=
      "pg369">369</a></span> woman, allowing a little imagination for
      her soul, and so forth. She would have made a great man."
    </p>

        [1] Johnson told Boswell: "You have only two topics, yourself
        and myself, and I am heartily sick of both."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This is just what Mrs. Piozzi never would have made. Her mind,
      despite her masculine acquirements, was thoroughly feminine: she
      had more tact than genius, more sensibility and quickness of
      perception than depth, comprehensiveness, or continuity of
      thought. But her very discursiveness prevented her from becoming
      wearisome: her varied knowledge supplied an inexhaustible store
      of topics and illustrations; her lively fancy placed them in
      attractive lights; and her mind has been well likened to a
      kaleidoscope which, whenever its glittering and heterogeneous
      contents are moved or shaken, surprises by some new combination
      of colour or of form. She professed to write as she talked; but
      her conversation was doubtless better than her books: her main
      advantages being a well-stored memory, fertility of images,
      aptness of allusion, and <i>apropos</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her colloquial excellence and her agreeability are established by
      the unanimous testimony of her cotemporaries. Her fame in this
      respect rests on the same basis as that of all great wits, all
      great actors, and many great orators. To question it for want of
      more tangible and durable proofs, would be as unreasonable as to
      question Sydney Smith's humour, Hook's powers of improvisation,
      Garrick's Richard, or Sheridan's Begum speech. But <i>ex pede
      Herculem</i>. Marked indications of her quality will be found in
      her letters and her books. "Both," remarks an acute and by no
      means <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg370" id=
      "pg370">370</a></span> partial critic<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span>, "are full of happy touches, and here and
      there will be found in them those deep and piercing thoughts
      which come intuitively to people of genius."

      Surely these are happy touches:
    </p>

      "I hate a general topic as a pretty woman hates a general
      mourning when black does not become her complexion."

      "Life is a schoolroom, not a playground."
    </p>
    <p>
      In allusion to the rage for scientific experiment in 1811: "Never
      was poor Nature so put to the rack, and never, of course, was she
      made to tell so many lies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Science (i.e. learning), which acted as a sceptre in the hand of
      Johnson, and was used as a club by Dr. Parr, became a lady's fan,
      when played with by George Henry Glasse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope is drawn with an anchor always, and Common Sense is never
      strong enough to draw it up."

      "The best writers are not the best friends; and the last
      character is more to be valued than the first by cotemporaries:
      after fifty years, indeed, the others carry away all the
      applause."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the reason why posterity always takes part with the
      famous author or man of genius against those who witnessed his
      meanness or suffered from his selfishness; why fresh apologists
      will constantly be found for <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "pg371" id="pg371">371</a></span> Bacon's want of principle and
      Johnson's want of manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of his famous definition or description of wit,
      Barrow says: "Sometimes it lieth in pat allusion to a known
      story, or in seasonable application of a trivial saying:
      sometimes it playeth in words and phrases, taking advantage from
      the ambiguity of their sense or the affinity of their sound." If
      this be so, she possessed it in abundance. In a letter, dated
      Bath, 26th April, 1818,&mdash;about the time when Talleyrand said
      of Lady F.S.'s robe: "<i>Elle commence trop tard et finit trop
      tôt</i>,"&mdash;she writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A genteel young clergyman, in our Upper Crescent, told his mamma
      about ten days ago, that he had lost his heart to pretty Miss
      Prideaux, and that he must absolutely marry her or die. <i>La
      chère mère</i> of course replied gravely: 'My dear, you have not
      been acquainted with the lady above a fortnight: let me recommend
      you to see more of her.' 'More of her!' exclaimed the lad, 'why I
      have seen down to the fifth rib on each side already.' This story
      will serve to convince Captain T. Fellowes and yourself, that as
      you have always acknowledged the British Belles to <i>exceed</i>
      those of every other nation, you may now say with truth, that
      they <i>outstrip</i> them."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st July, 1818:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heat has certainly exhausted my faculties, and I have but
      just life enough left to laugh at the fourteen tailors who,
      united under a flag with '<i>Liberty and Independence</i>'
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg372" id="pg372">372</a></span>
      on it, went to vote for some of these gay fellows, I forget
      which, but the motto is ill chosen, said I, they should have
      written up, '<i>Measures not Men</i>'"

      Her verses are advantageously distinguished amongst those of her
      blue-stocking contemporaries by happy turns of thought and
      expression, natural playfulness, and an abundant flow of
      idiomatic language. But her facility was a fatal gift, as it has
      proved to most female aspirants to poetic fame, who rarely stoop
      to the labour of the file. Although the first rule laid down by
      Goldsmith's connoisseur<span class="fnref">[1]</span> is far from
      universally applicable to productions of the pencil or the pen,
      all fruitful writers would do well to act upon it, and what Mrs.
      Piozzi could do when she took pains is decisively proved by her
      "Streatham Portraits."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] "Upon my asking him how he had acquired the art of a
        conoscente so very suddenly, he assured me that nothing was
        more easy. The whole secret consisted in an adherence to two
        rules: the one always to observe that the picture might have
        been better if the painter had taken more pains; and the other
        to praise the works of Pietro Perugino."&mdash;<i>The Vicar of
        Wakefield</i>, ch. xx.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      She was wanting in refinement, which very few of the eighteenth
      century wits and authors possessed according to more modern
      notions; and she abounded in vanity, which, if not necessarily a
      baneful or unamiable quality, is a fruitful source of folly and
      peculiarly calculated to provoke censure or ridicule. In her,
      fortunately, its effects were a good deal modified by the
      frankness of its avowal and display, by her habits of
      self-examination, by her impulsive generosity of character, and
      by her readiness to admit the claims and consult the feelings
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg373" id="pg373">373</a></span>
      of others. To seek out and appreciate merit as she appreciated
      it, is a high merit in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her piety was genuine; and old-fashioned politicians, whose
      watchword is Church and King, will be delighted with her
      politics. Literary men, considering how many curious inquiries
      depend upon her accuracy, will be more anxious about her
      truthfulness, and I have had ample opportunities of testing it;
      having not only been led to compare her narratives with those of
      others, but to collate her own statements of the same
      transactions or circumstances at distant intervals or to
      different persons. It is difficult to keep up a large
      correspondence without frequent repetition. Sir Walter Scott used
      to write precisely the same things to three or four fine-lady
      friends, and Mrs. Piozzi could no more be expected to find a
      fresh budget of news or gossip for each epistle than the author
      of "Waverley." Thus, in 1815, she writes to a Welsh baronet from
      Bath:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have had a fine Dr. Holland here.<span class=
      "fnref">[1]</span> He has seen and written about the Ionian
      Islands; and means now to practise as a physician, exchanging the
      Cyclades, say we wits and wags, for the Sick Ladies. We made
      quite a lion of the man. I was invited to every house he visited
      at for the last three days; so I got the <i>Queue du lion</i>
      despairing of <i>le Coeur</i>."
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">
      <p>
        [1] Sir Henry Holland, Bart., who, with many other titles to
        distinction, is one of the most active and enterprising of
        modern travellers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Two other letters written about the same time contain the same
      piece of intelligence and the same joke. <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="pg374" id="pg374">374</a></span> She was very
      fond of writing marginal notes; and after annotating one copy of
      a book, would take up another and do the same. I have never
      detected a substantial variation in her narratives, even in those
      which were more or less dictated by pique; and as she generally
      drew upon the "Thraliana" for her materials, this, having been
      carefully and calmly compiled, affords an additional guarantee
      for her accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her taste for reading never left her or abated to the last. In
      reference to a remark (in Boswell) on the irksomeness of books to
      people of advanced age, she writes: "Not to me at eighty years
      old: being grieved that year (1819) particularly, I was forced
      upon study to relieve my mind, and it had the due effect. I wrote
      this note in 1820."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sometimes gives anecdotes of authors. Thus, in the letter
      just quoted, she says: "Lord Byron protests his wife was a
      fortune without money, a belle without beauty, and a
      blue-stocking without either wit or learning." But her literary
      information grew scanty as she grew old: "The literary world (she
      writes in 1821) is to me terra incognita, far more deserving of
      the name, now Parry and Ross are returned, than any part of the
      polar regions:" and her opinions of the rising authors are
      principally valuable as indications of the obstacles which
      budding reputations must overcome. "Pindar's fine remark
      respecting the different effects of music on different
      characters, holds equally true of genius: so many as are not
      delighted by it are disturbed, perplexed, irritated. The beholder
      either recognises <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg375" id=
      "pg375">375</a></span> it as a projected form of his own being,
      that moves before him with a glory round its head, or recoils
      from it as a spectre."<span class="fnref">[1]</span> The
      octogenarian critic of the Johnsonian school recoils from
      "Frankenstein" as from an incarnation of the Evil Spirit: she
      does not know what to make of the "Tales of my Landlord"; and she
      inquires of an Irish acquaintance whether she retained
      recollection enough of her own country to be entertained with
      "that strange caricature, Castle Rack Rent." Contemporary
      judgments such as these (not more extravagant than Horace
      Walpole's) are to the historian of literature what fossil remains
      are to the geologist.

      Although perhaps no biographical sketch was ever executed, as a
      labour of love, without an occasional attack of what Lord
      Macaulay calls the <i>Lues Boswelliana</i> or fever of
      admiration, I hope it is unnecessary for me to say that I am not
      setting up Mrs. Piozzi as a model letter-writer, or an eminent
      author, or a pattern of the domestic virtues, or a fitting object
      of hero or heroine worship in any capacity. All I venture to
      maintain is, that her life and character, if only for the sake of
      the "associate forms," deserve to be vindicated against unjust
      reproach, and that she has written many things which are worth
      snatching from oblivion or preserving from decay.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
